% odeRK4sys  Fourth order Runge-Kutta method for systems of first order ODEs
%            Nonvectorized version
%
% Synopsis:  [t,y] = odeRK4sys(diffeq,tn,h,y0)
%
% Input:     diffeq = (string) name of the m-file that evaluates the right
%                      hand side of the ODE system written in standard form.
%            tn      = stoping value of the independent variable
%            h       = stepsize for advancing the independent variable
%            y0      = vector of the dependent variable values at t = 0
%
% Output:    t = vector of independent variable values:  t(j) = (j-1)*h
%            y = matrix of dependent variables values, one column for each
%                state variable.  Each row is from a different time step.

   end

   for n=1:neq                          %  Simultaneously advance all y's
