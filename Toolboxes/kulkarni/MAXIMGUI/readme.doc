MAXIMGUI is a software package written in MATLAB (version 5.1) and intended to be used with the book ``Modeling, Analysis, Design and Control of Stochastic Systems'' by V G Kulkarni, published by Springer-Verlag, 1999. The graphical user interface is created using GUI tools provided under MATLAB version 5.1, and uses no special MATLAB toolboxes. These m-files are User Contributed Routines which are being redistributed by The MathWorks, upon request, on an "as is" basis. A User Contributed Routine is not a product of The MathWorks, Inc. and The Mathworks assumes no responsibility for any errors that may exist in these routines.

The user may modify the files for personal use, but then must change
 the name of the file. Also, the user is not permitted to sell the
 software after modifying it. If the software is used for commercial
 or academic purposes, it should be properly acknowledged. 

The user should download the entire directory structure unaltered.
 Then, assuming the top directory maximgui resides in the root directory in c: drive,
 the user should invoke MATLAB and  type 
cd C:\maximgui
at the MATLAB >> prompt. Then type
start_maxim
at the MATLAB prompt. The user will get a graphical window with a main menu.
 Click on the "help" item on the menu bar in this window for further help. 
The "help" item appears on almost all graphical windows produced by MAXIMGUI.
 User can click on it to obtain pertinent help.
                             ***WARNING***
               Always use the exit option or cancel button
               to close a window produced by MAXIMGUI. Using
               the X button on th top right hand corner of
               a window can lead to strange behavior, and 
               may sometimes hang the system.
