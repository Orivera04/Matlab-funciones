README file for the Modern Control System Theory and Design Toolbox.
Designed by S. M. Shinners to accompany his book:
                           Modern Control System Theory and Desgin

3 April 1994

  This diskette of software was created to assist the reader using this book
with implemented problem solutions, text examples, figures, a powerful
collection of M-File functions (toolbox), a Tutorial File explaining MATLAB
fundamentals, a Demo M-File illustrating the uses of this toolbox, and a
Synopsis File that reviews and highlights features of each chapter.  The
files contained on this diskette constitute the "Modern Control System Theory
and Design Toolbox" and are designed for use with the "Modern Control System
Theory and Design" textbook and Solutions Manual, authored by S. Shinners,
and published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

  This toolbox was created to enhance The MathWorks' "Control System 
Toolbox" or "Signals and Systems Toolbox" (which is part of the Student 
Edition of MATLAB) with features/utilities currently not implemented as 
such.  The heart of most of these utilities in the Modern Control System 
Theory and Design Toolbox is MALTAB's ability to find the roots of a 
polynomial equation (any order in  height) quite accurately (See "ROOTS"  
in MATLAB's manual).  The solution of characteristic equations is worked 
out using the "ROOTS" function.  The results, as such, should always be  
checked for reasonableness.  The Modern Control System Theory and Design 
Toolbox can be broken into 4 Categories :

        1) Polynomial Utilities (applicable to most transfer functions)
        2) Interpolation Utilities (for interpolating between data points)
        3) Control Utilities (specific applications as listed)
        4) Nonlinear Functions (Using the Describing Function Method)

     While the first category (polynomial utilities) sounds trivial, the
practical applications of these functions relate directly to the desired
control analysis quantities.  Some practical control examples of the 
polynomial utilities are:

        Polysbst { go from S to JW domain,
                 { transform (scale/transport/rotate) axis in root locus plot
                 { continuous to discrete transformations (substitutions)
        Polymag  { Bode Plot: Pick any gain frequency (0db=P.M., -3db=B.W.)
        Polyangl { Bode Plot: Pick any phase frequency (-180=G.M.)
        Rootmag  { Root Locus: Pick a particular S/Z magnitude (Unit Circle)
        Rootangl { Root Locus: Pick a particular damping angle

  The problem solutions, text examples, and figures have been implemented
using either the Control System Toolbox, the Signals and Systems Toolbox, 
the Modern Control System Theory and Design Toolbox, the Symbolic Toolbox,
the Non-linear Toolbox, Simulink or a combination thereof.

DISCLAIMER : These M-files (scripts and functions) for all applications in 
this book and Solutions Manual have been supplied to The MathWorks, Inc., 
for distribution, upon request, on an "as is"  basis.  Although these 
routines have been carefully checked, The MathWorks and I assume no 
responsibility and/or liability for the correctness of the M-files, or any 
errors that exist in this Modern Control System Theory and Design Toolbox.
Users of this toolbox are encouraged to contact me if you have any questions.
