<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">CAN Calibration Protocol Demo Model</p>
<p> Demonstrates use of the CAN Calibration Protocol with the Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555.</p>
<p>During code generation for the CCP demo model, an ASAP2 file is generated. Using the ASAP2 file, you can use a third party CAN calibration tool to view data from the target MPC555 collected via CAN. When an external tool such as CANape is used to modify parameter values, the CCP protocol provides a means of monitoring signals and altering the parameter values in the controller code running on the target MPC555.</p>
<p>The primary model contains a variety of signals that can be monitored including the output signal of a simple counter, with tunable step size. The generated ASAP2 file allows a calibration tool to tune STEP_PARAM and monitor signals such as COUNTER_SIGNAL.
