<p>This demonstration shows how to use Ideal Airspeed Correction block to compute
true airspeed from indicated airspeed.</p> 

<h4>Demonstration Background</h4>
<p>True airspeed is the airspeed that we would read ideally (and the airspeed value 
easily calculated within a simulation). However there are errors introduced throught 
the pitot-static airspeed indicators used to determine airspeed. These measurement errors 
are 
<ul>
<li>density error</li>
<li>compressibility error and </li>
<li>calibration error.</li>
</ul>
Applying these errors to true airspeed will result in indicated airspeed.  
(the ideal airspeed correction block can handle the density error and compressibility error)
</p>

<p><i>Density Error</i><br>
It is a fact that an airspeed indicator reads lower than true airspeed at higher altitudes. 
This is due to lower air density at altitude.  When the difference or error in air density 
at altitude from air density on a standard day at sea level is applied to true airspeed, it 
results in equivalent airspeed (EAS).  Equivalent airspeed is true airspeed modified with 
the changes in atmospheric density which affect the airspeed indicator.</p>

<p><i>Compressibility Error</i><br> 
Air has a limited ability to resist compression. This ability is reduced by an increase in 
altitude, an increase in speed, or a restricted volume.  Within the airspeed indicator, there 
is a certain amount of trapped air. When flying at high altitudes and higher airspeeds, calibrated 
airspeed (CAS) is always higher than equivalent airspeed.  Calibrated airspeed is equivalent 
airspeed modified with compressibility effects of air which affect the airspeed indicator.</p>

<p><i>Calibration Error</i><br>
The airspeed indicator has static vent(s) to maintain a pressure equal to atmospheric pressure 
inside the instrument. Position and placement of the static vent along with angle of attack and 
velocity of the aircraft will determine the pressure inside the airspeed indicator and thus the 
amount of calibration error of the airspeed indicator.  Needless to say, calibration error is specific 
to a given aircraft design.  A calibration table is usally given in the pilot operating handbook (POH) 
or in other aircraft specifications.  Using this calibration table, the indicated airspeed (IAS) is 
determined from calibrated airspeed by modifing it with calibration error of the airspeed indicator. 
Indicated airspeed is displayed in the cockpit instrumentation.
