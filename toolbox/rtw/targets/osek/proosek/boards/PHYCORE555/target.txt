Notes for operating the phyCORE-MPC555 evaluation board 
=======================================================

The ProOSEK target is setup to run from external RAM mapped at addres
0x0. This permits emulation of a flash based environment were you have
to place all code and constant data within the address range 0x000000
- 0x06ffff. Execution after reset will start at address 0x100.

The factory settings should be suitable for running code downloaded
via BDM. 

Before loading the code into RAM you must disable the FLEN bit. 
(By disabling the bit in the IMMR using your BDM software). Then,
disable CS0 and activate CS1 (e.g. write 0x00000000 to 0x2fc100 and
0x00000001 to 0x2fc108). This is done for you by the automated
download and run feature of the ProOSEK target that relies on
the SingleStep debugger. 

Now, the external RAM should be accessible from address 0 and the
application can be downloaded and run using BDM.
