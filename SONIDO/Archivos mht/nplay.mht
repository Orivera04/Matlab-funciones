<BODY><PRE>function nplay(music)
%NPLAY  Play music.
% NPLAY plays the tune represented by the specially formatted music
% array.
%
% Syntax: nPlay(music)
%
% Arguments:
% music - n-by-2 cell array, music{:,1} contains strings and music{:,2}
% numeric scalars.
%
% Usage and output:
% nplay(music) plays a tune on the speakers using the nsound function to
% create pitch vectors for each note and MATLAB's sound function to play
% the note on the speakers. Each row of the cell array music represents =
one
% note to be played, and the duration to play it. The suported notes are
% those recognized by nsound. The character 'p' can appear instead of a
% note to produce silence for the specified duration. See nsound.m for =
more
% information on supported notes and their string representation.
%
% Examples:
% nplay({'C4',0.5;'D4',0.5;'E4',0.5})
% plays the short tune 'do-re-mi'.
%
% music=3D{'A4',0.20;'p',0.05;'A4',0.20;'p',0.05;...
%        'G4',0.20;'p',0.05;'A4',0.20;'p',0.3;...
%        'E4',0.20;'p',0.25;...
%        'E4',0.20;'p',0.05;'A4',0.20;'p',0.05;...
%        'D5',0.20;'p',0.05;'C#5',0.20;'p',0.05;...
%        'A4',0.30};
% nplay(music)
% Plays the first few notes of Funky Town.
