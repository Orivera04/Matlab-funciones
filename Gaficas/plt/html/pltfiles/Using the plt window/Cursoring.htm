<h3>Selecting the active trace</h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/CursorID.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="166" height="64">Simply click on the trace you wish to cursor. The cursor will move to the 
trace you clicked on and that trace will become active. The x and y-cursor edit 
boxes will change to the color of the new active trace and those edit boxes will 
be updated to contain the current x and y locations of the cursor. Although the 
color of the edit box will often be enough to let you know which trace is active it 
sometimes may be difficult to tell at a glance if there are many traces plotted. 
For this reason a cursor ID tag is displayed just to the left of the 
y-cursor edit box. This will be especially helpful if you assigned meaningful 
trace names in the plt calling sequence. This cursor ID tag is also in the same 
color as the active trace.</p>

<h3>Dragging the cursor</h3>

<p>Click on a trace, hold down the mouse button and drag the cursor left or 
right. The cursor will follow the mouse as you are dragging and the edit boxes 
will continually update with the current cursor location. Make sure you click 
directly on the trace. If you are not close enough to the trace, when you drag 
the mouse the x and y axis limits will pan to follow the mouse movement.</p>

<h3>Typing in a cursor location</h3>

<p>If you type a new value into the x-cursor edit box, the cursor will move to 
(x,y) where x is the value you typed in, and y is the value of the active trace 
at location x. (i.e. the cursor will remain on the active trace). However if you 
type a new value into the y-cursor edit box, the cursor will move up or down (off 
the trace) to the location (x,y) where x is the old cursor x position, and y is 
the value you typed in.</p>
<h3>Finding peaks or valleys</h3>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/CursorButtons.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="55" height="48">In 
the lower left corner of the display you will find the cursor peak/valley 
buttons (up and down arrows) as well as the delta cursor button. When you click 
on the up arrow (peak finder), the cursor will move to the largest peak in the 
current display range of the active trace. The next click on the up arrow will move 
the cursor to the second largest peak and so on. Any cursor movement 
other than a peak/valley button will reset the peak finder so that the next time 
you click on the up arrow the cursor again moves to the largest peak in the 
display range. The valley button works the same as the peak button except the 
cursor moves to successive local minima.</p>
<h3>Delta cursors</h3>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../images/DeltaCursor.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="627" height="199"></p>

<p>
Delta 
cursors are useful for measuring horizontal or vertical distances between two 
points on a trace. First move the cursor to the desired reference point on the 
trace. Then press the Delta (<font face="Times New Roman">&#8710;) cursor button. The 
reference location will be marked with a large red plus (about 4 times bigger 
than the normal cursor). Then click on a different point on the same trace (or drag 
the cursor to the desired location). The view will then look similar to the 
picture shown here. You can read the current location of the cursor (the small 
yellow plus) in the usual way - i.e. the edit boxes just to the right of the 
grey x/y labels. In this case the cursor x location is 5.75 msec and the y 
location is 0.377755. The other two edit boxes show how far away the cursor is 
from the marked reference. In this example, it shows that the cursor at a 
location 1.55 msec later than and .37885 units less than the marked reference. 
Simply click on the delta cursor button again, and the reference mark will 
disappear and the usual cursor operation will return.</font></p>

  </table>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;When you click on the  cursor ID tag (Line 4 in this example) the ID tag 
changes to <span class="mcode">Y/X</span> and the value in the y-cursor edit box changes to show the 
ratio of the y and x cursor values at the current cursor position (i.e. the 
slope of the line from the origin to the cursor). If delta cursors were enabled, 
and additional edit box appears to the right of the y-cursor edit box. This 
additional box contains <font face="Times New Roman">&#916;Y/&#916;X, which is the slope of 
the line connecting the marked position to the current cursor. You can use this 
to estimate the slope of a trace at a particular point.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When you click on the ID tag a second time, the 
<span class="mcode">Y/X</span> changes to <span class="mcode">Avg</span> and the edit box then shows</font> the average y-value of all the points 
of the active trace that are within the current display x limits.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When you click on the ID tag a third time, the
<span class="mcode">Avg</span> changes to <span class="mcode">RMS</span> and the edit box then shows</font> the rms value of the active 
trace. As with Avg, the rms calculation only includes points that are within the currently 
displayed x-axis limits. (In case you are not familiar with this commonly used form 
of averaging - rms stands for &quot;root mean square&quot; and is calculated by taking the 
square root of the average of the squares of the data values).</p>

<p>Clicking the ID tag a fourth time (or clicking in the plot area) restores the 
cursor readout to show the usual Y value and the ID tag again shows the name of 
the cursored trace.</p>
