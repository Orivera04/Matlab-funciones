%   STEP1 -- Experiments with first-order systems
%
%This demosntration plots the unity step response of a linear first order system.
%The user can change the time constant and gain of the system by manipulating
%the sliders.   
%
%The unity step funciton is shown in yellow, the system response in violet.  
%
%When the "Show Lines" button is pressed, the construction lines which
%indicate the time constant are drawn. 
%
%A green line, drawn tangent to the response at time t=0 terminates at the 
%steady-state value of the response.  The vertical green line from that point 
%intersects the time axis at the value of the time constant (see text, Chapter 5). 
%
%A red horizontal line is drawn at a value of 63.2% of the steady-state value of 
%the response and intersects the response curve at time  t=time_constant.
