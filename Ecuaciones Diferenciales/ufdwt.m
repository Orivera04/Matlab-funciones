%
% Compute Finite Difference Weights for a Uniform Grid
%
% Input Parameters:
%
% h     - spacing between FD nodes
% pts   - number of FD points in scheme (3-pt, 5-pt, etc)
% order - order of the derivative operator to compute weights for
%         (note: order<pts-1!)
%         1 computes first derivative differences       
%         2 computes second derivative differences, etc
%  
% Output Parameter:
%
% W is the weight matrix. Each row contains a different set of weights
% (centered or off). If, for example, the number of finite difference points
% is odd, the centered difference weights will appear in the middle row.
