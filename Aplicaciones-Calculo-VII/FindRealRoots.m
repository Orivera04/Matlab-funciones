function roots=FindRealRoots(funhandle,a,b,n)

% Finds all the real roots of the function 'funhandle' over the interval
% [a,b] by a Chebyshev polynomial approximation method using n polynomials.
% Plots out the original function and the Chebyshev expansion, so that if
% the approximation is poor then a higher valuer of n can be used.

% We begin by obtaining the Chebyshev coefficients for the function
c=chebft(funhandle,a,b,n);

% Define A as the Frobenius-Chebyshev companion matrix. This is based
% on the form given by J.P. Boyd, Appl. Num. Math. 56 pp.1077-1091 (2006).
A=zeros(n-1);   % "n-1" because Boyd's notation includes the zero-indexed
A(1,2)=1;       % elements whereas Matlab's of course does not allow this. 
                % In other words, to replicate Boyd's N=5 matrix we need to 
                % set n=6.

% Now we have the companion matrix, we can find its eigenvalues using the
% MATLAB built-in function.
eigvals=eig(A);

% We're only interested in the real elements of the matrix:
realvals=(arrayfun(@(x) ~any(imag(x)),eigvals)).*eigvals;

% Of course these are the roots scaled to the canonical interval [-1,1]. We
% need to map them back onto the interval [a,b]; we widen the interval just
% a fraction to make sure that we don't miss any that are right on the
% edge.
