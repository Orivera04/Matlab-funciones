function poly2 = clipConvexPolygon3dPlane(poly, plane)
%clipConvexPolygon3dPlane clip a convex 3D polygon with Half-space
%
%   usage :
%   POLY2 = clipConvexPolygon3dPlane(POLY, PLANE)
%   POLY is a [Nx3] array of points, and PLANE is given as :
%   [x0 y0 z0 dx1 dy1 dz1 dx2 dy2 dz2].
%   The result POLY2 is also an array of 3d points, sometimes smaller than
%   poly, and that can be [0x3] (empty polygon).
%
%   POLY2 = clipConvexPolygon3dPlane(POLY, PT0, NORMAL)
%   uses plane with normal NORMAL and containing point PT0.
%
%   There is a problem for non-convex polygons, as they can be clipped in
%   several polygons. Possible solutions:
%   - create another function 'clipConvexPolygon3dPlane' or
%       'clipConvexPolygon3d', using a simplified algorithm
%   - returns a list of polygons instead of a single polygon,
%   - in the case of one polygon as return decide what to return
%   - and rename this function to 'clipPolygon3d'

%   HISTORY

% ensure last point is the same as the first one
if sum(poly(end, :)==poly(1,:))~=3
    poly = [poly; poly(1,:)];
end


% initialize empty polygon
poly2 = zeros(0, 2);

% compute visible points
below = isBelowPlane(poly, plane);

% case of empty polygon
if sum(below)==0
    return;
end

% case of totally clipped polygon
if sum(below)==length(below)
    poly2 = poly;
    return;
end

% indices of edges intersecting the plane
ind = find(below~=below([2:end 1]));

% compute intersection points: they are 2 for a convex polygon
lines = createLine3d(poly(ind, :), poly(ind+1, :));
pInt = intersectPlaneLine(plane, lines);

% insert intersection points and remove invisible points
if below(1)
    poly2 = [poly(1:ind(1), :); pInt; poly(ind(2)+1:end, :)];
else
    poly2 = [pInt(1, :); poly(ind(1)+1:ind(2), :); pInt(2, :)];
end


% remove last point if it is the same as the first one
if sum(poly2(end, :)==poly(1,:))==2
    poly2 = poly2(1:end-1, :);
