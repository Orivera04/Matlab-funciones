% Basic Introduction to the Numerical Methods with MATLAB (NMM) Toolbox
%
% The NMM Toolbox is a collection of m-files and data to accompany the text,
% "Numerical Methods with MATLAB:  Implementation and Application", Gerald
% W. Recktenwald, 2000, Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-201-30860-6
%
% The files in the NMM toolbox are Copyright, 1996-2001, by Gerald
% W. Recktenwald.  The m-files and data may be freely distributed
% under the following conditions:
%
%   1. The toolbox files may not be sold.  This includes distribution
%      via shareware, or promotional electronic media where individuals
%      are charged for the archive.
%   2. The user of the toolbox files assumes all liability for their use.
%   3. The toolbox, including the m-files, data files and all readme
%      and other documentation files must remain intact.  Modified versions
%      of these files must be renamed.

% More Information:
% -----------------
%
%   For installation instructions read the file called install.m
%   To make the NMM Toolbox routines accessible you will need to configure
%   the internal MATLAB path.
%
%   To check the version of an NMM Toolbox installation, enter
%
%       nmmVersion
%
%   at the MATLAB command prompt.  To get a summary total of the m-files
%   and data files installed, enter
%
%       nmmCheck(0)
%
%   The numerical methods used by the functions in the toolbox are
%   documented in "Numerical Methods with MATLAB:  Implementation and
%   Application", Gerald W. Recktenwald, 2000, Prentice-Hall.
