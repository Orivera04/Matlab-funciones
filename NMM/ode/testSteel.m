function testSteel
% testSteel  Verify that solutions obtained by ode45 are independent of
%            interpolative refinement.  Solution is obtained with default
%            refinement (= 4) and with no refinement.

% Synopsis:  testSteel
%
% Input:  none
%
% Output:  Every fourth time step from refined solution is printed along with 
%          all steps from unrefined solution. Solutions are identical.
