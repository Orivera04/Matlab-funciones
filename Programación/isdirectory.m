function [t, newdir] = isdirectory(dir)
%ISDIRECTORY True if argument is a directory.
%
%   ISDIRECTORY(DIR) returns 1 if DIR is a directory and 0 otherwise.  [T,
%   NEWDIR] = ISDIRECTORY(DIR) also returns the name of the directory as
%   returned by CD.  NEWDIR is empty if DIR is not a directory.
%
%   Using EXIST(DIR, 'dir') is too unreliable.  For instance, under Windows it
%   returns false if DIR is 'c:' (where c: is an existing drive) and it returns
%   false and if DIR is a directory which is in the path but does not exist.
