and Controller</p>

<p>This demonstration shows NASA's HL-20 lifting body modeled in Simulink and
Aerospace Blockset.  This model simulates approach and landing flight phases using
an auto-landing controller.</p> 

<h4>Demonstration Background</h4>

<p>The HL-20 also known as personnel launch system (PLS) is a lifting body re-entry 
vehicle that was designed to complement the Space Shuttle orbiter. Designed to carry 
up to ten people and very little cargo[1], the HL-20 lifting body was to be placed in 
orbit either launched vertically via booster rockets or transported in the payload bay 
of the Space Shuttle orbiter. HL-20 lifting body was designed to have a powered 
deorbiting accomplished with an onboard propulsion system while its reentry was to be 
nose-first, horizontal and unpowered.</p>

<p>The HL-20 lifting body was developed as a low cost solution for getting to and 
from low Earth orbit. The proposed benefits of the HL-20 were reduced operating 
costs due to rapid turnaround between landing and launch, improved flight safety, 
and ability to land conventionally on runways.  Potential scenarios for the HL-20 
were orbital rescue of stranded astronauts, International Space Station crew 
exchange if the Space Shuttle orbiter was not available, observation missions, and 
satellite servicing missions.</p>
