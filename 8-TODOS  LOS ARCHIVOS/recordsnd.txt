Hello,
  In this post, I'm including a shareware version of
RECORDSND written for Matlab 5.  RECORDSND.DLL is a Mex file
for PC Windows that allows you to record sound directly into a
Matlab matrix.  It allows you to record mono or stereo sounds,
with various sampling rates and bit resolutions (depending upon
the capabilities of your sound board).  Note that this version
of RECORDSND will record a maximum of a second of data.  In
order to receive the full asynchronous and synchronous versions
of RECORDSND, please send your email address and a check for $25
to the following address:
  Daniel D. Lee
  806 Morris Tpk. #3O2
  Short Hills, NJ 07078

Also, please feel free to send me any suggestions for improvements.
Thanks for your support!

-Dan

P.S. If you have the Linux version of Matlab, I have previously posted
the source code for the Linux Mex version of RECORDSND.
