    Our basic idea is based on (n,k)-gray code which was introduced in one  paper named :"Generalized Gray Codes with Applications". Our extention is allowing each digit ranged from different digit which is widely useful in some situations.For example, (3,2)-Gray code is (0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(1,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(2,0). The parameter 3 is the range of each digit {0,1,2}, and 2 restricts there are 2 digits. 
     Our extended gray code is working in this way. For example, if we want to generate gray code with the range of {2 3 3 4} for each digit as input parameter, our function will produce: 0000,1000,1100,0100,0200,1200,1210,0210,........ in total of 72 sequences.  



We extend normal gray code to conside about different range for each digit, not just binary but also the most complicated gray code
