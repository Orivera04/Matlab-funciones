<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Embedded Target
for Infineon C166® Microcontrollers Demonstrations</p>

<p>The Embedded Target for Infineon C166® Microcontrollers enables you to run Real-Time 
Workshop Embedded Coder generated code on a device belonging to this family of microcontrollers.</p>

<p>Core capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic build, download and run on target hardware
<li>Automatic build and launch debugger
<li>Single-tasking or multi-tasking execution without real-time operating system
<li>Support for C166 bit-addressable memory
<li>Report generation with RAM/ROM measurements
</ul>

<p>The Embedded Target for Infineon C166® Microcontrollers supports rapid prototyping and deployment 
of your application, as well as code validation and performance analysis.</p>
<p>See the demos for examples of automatic code generation and download to the target, real-time I/O models, the use of C166 bit-addressable memory, integrating hand-coded I/O functions, multitasking, execution profiling and the use of fixed point for efficient code generation.</p>

<h3>Block Libraries</h3>
<p>The Embedded Target for Infineon C166® Microcontrollers includes an
I/O driver library that lets you add I/O driver blocks to your controller model
for interfacing to hardware. The blocks are contained in the following sublibraries:<p>

<ul>
<li>Asynchronous/Synchronous Serial Interface
<p>You can add Serial Transmit and Receive Blocks to your controller, to configure the C166 for serial communications. </p>

<li>CAN Interface
<p>You can add CAN Message Blocks to your controller, enabling you to send CAN messages containing signal data from your controller subsystem using either standard or extended CAN identifiers.</p>

<li>Execution Profiling
<p>Execution Profiling blocks provide an interface to the execution profiling engine over serial or CAN. On receipt of a start command message, logging of execution profile data is commenced. On completion of a logging run, the recorded data is automatically returned via serial or CAN.</p>

<li>TwinCAN Interface
<p>For processor variants such as the XC16x, there is support for the TwinCAN module.
</ul>
