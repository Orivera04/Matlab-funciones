% DYNOPT Toolbox, PbCodes, Examples, Subcodes, and Figures for
% "Dynamic Optimization" by A. E. Bryson, Addison-Wesley-Longman,
% 1999 - Codes revised 9/15/02 for MATLAB Version 6.1.

% These M-files are User Contributed Routines that are being distributed 
% by the Mathworks, upon request, on an "as is" basis.  A User Contributed
% Routine is not a product of the Mathworks, Inc. and the Mathworks assumes
% no responsibility for any errors that may exist in these routines.
%
% These codes have been revised to be consistent with MATLAB Version 6.1. The
% codes on the disk distributed with the book were consistent with Version 5.
% The main differences are in the Optimization Toolbox where the functions
% CONSTR and FMIN were changed to FMINCON and FMINUNC and the numeric 
% OPTIONS was changed to the alpha-numeric OPTIMSET. The syntax of FSOLVE
% was changed and the function TABLE1 was changed to INTERP1. LP was
% changed to LINPROG and QUADPROG was added.

% A list of errors in the book is available from the author in MSWord or
% in LaTex. Send your request to brysonae@stanford.edu.
