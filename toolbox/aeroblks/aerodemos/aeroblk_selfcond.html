<p>This demonstration shows the implementation of a state-space controller [A,B,C,D] 
in a self-conditioned form versus a typical state-space controller [A,B,C,D].
</p>

<h4>Demonstration Background</h4>

<p>For the self-conditioned state-space controller, if measured control value is equal to 
the demanded control value (u_meas = u_dem), then the controller implementation is 
the typical state-space controller [A,B,C,D]. However if measured control value (u_meas) 
is limited, e.g., rate limiting, then the poles of the controller become those defined in the 
mask dialog box.
</p>

<h4>Demonstration Output</h4>

<p>The results of a typical state-space controller [A,B,C,D] and a self-conditioned state-space 
controller with a limited measured control value are shown below.</p>
