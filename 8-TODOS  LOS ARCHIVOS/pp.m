function [line_handle] = pp(varargin)

%PP  Plots and manipulates polar plots
%
%   PP(THETA,R) plots the polar representation of THEATA and R with the 
%   centre and max values being the minimum and maximum values of R.
%
%   PP(THETA,R,S) plots as above, where S is a character string made from
%   standard plotting formatting in the PLOT function. See HELP PLOT.
%
%   PP(THETA,R,A) plots as above, but within the axis limits of A. A is 
%   a 1x2 or 2x1 array containing the centre value and maximum value of 
%   the polar plot ring axes.
%
%   PP(THETA,R,'Property 1',...) plots as above with the selected 
%   properties. See below for propterties. 
%
%   PP('Property 1',...) edits the current figure (if it is a polar plot 
%   figure) to the assigned properties.
%
%   PP('Trace', 3, 'Property 1', ... , 'Trace', 1, 'Property 10', ... )
%   changes properties of trace 3 and trace one. Any properties defined
%   after the trace belong to that trace until a new trace number is 
%   defined.
