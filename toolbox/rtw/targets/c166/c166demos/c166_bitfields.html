<p>The C166 has special instructions for accessing bit-addressable memory. For variables that
are declared as bit-addressable, the compiler is able to generate assembler code using these
special instructions, thereby resulting in reduced code size and faster execution. This example
shows how to configure your model to take advantage of bit-addressable memory.</p>

<ol>
<li>To open this model, click the link or at the command line type
<a href="matlab:c166_bitfields">c166_bitfields
</a>
<li>Double click the block <strong>Generate code and launch debugger</strong>.
<li>Double click the block <strong>Read documentation for C166 bit-addressable memory</strong> to see a tutorial explaining this example in detail in the User's Guide, "Custom Storage Class for C166 Microcontroller Bit-Addressable Memory".
