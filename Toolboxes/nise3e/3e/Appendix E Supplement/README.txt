INSTRUCTIONS
The following software is required in order to use the files 
in the Appendix E Supplement folder: MATLAB Version 5, 
MATLAB's Control System Toolbox Version 4 and MATLAB's 
Symbolic Math Toolbox Version 2. Follow the 
installation instructions included with MATLAB.

Be sure to add the folder "MATLAB files for Appendix E" to 
MATLAB's search path by using the Path Browser found in Set 
Path under the File menu or on the Command Window Toolbar. 

To see the computer responses after installing the M-files, 
run each problem by typing the M-file name, such as ch13sp1, 
after the prompt (>>) in the Command window. To view all or 
part of the M-file in the Command window, enter 
"type <file name>" or "help <file name>", respectively, after 
the prompt.
