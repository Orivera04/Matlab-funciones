function [c,R2,rout] = fitqr(x,y,basefun)
% fitqr  Least-squares fit via solution of overdetermined system with QR
%        Given ordered pairs of data, (x_i,y_i), i=1,...,m, fitqr
%        returns the vector of coefficients, c_1,...,c_n, such that
%            F(x) = c_1*f_1(x) + c_2*f_2(x) + ... + c_n*f_n(x)
%        minimizes the L2 norm of y_i - F(x_i).

% Synopsis:  c       = fitqr(x,y,basefun)
%           [c,R2]   = fitqr(x,y,basefun)
%           [c,R2,r] = fitqr(x,y,basefun)

% Input:   x,y     = vectors of data to be fit
%          basefun = (string) name of user-supplied m-file that computes
%                    matrix A.  The columns of A are the values of the
%                    basis functions evaluated at the x data points.
%
% Output:  c = vector of coefficients obtained from the fit
%          R2 = (optional) adjusted coefficient of determination; 0 <= R2 <= 1
%               R2 close to 1 indicates a strong relationship between y and x
%          r  = (optional) residuals of the fit

c = A\y(:);              %  Solve overdetermined system with QR factorization
