function dnurbs = nrbderiv(nurbs)
% 
% Function Name:
% 
%   nrbderiv - Construct the first derivative representation of a
%              NURBS curve or surface.
% 
% Calling Sequence:
% 
%   ders = nrbderiv(nrb);
% 
% Parameters:
% 
%   nrb		: NURBS data structure, see nrbmak.
% 
%   ders	: A data structure that represents the first
% 		  derivatives of a NURBS curve or surface.
% 
% Description:
% 
%   The derivatives of a B-Spline are themselves a B-Spline of lower degree,
%   giving an efficient means of evaluating multiple derivatives. However,
%   although the same approach can be applied to NURBS, the situation for
%   NURBS is a more complex. I have at present restricted the derivatives
%   to just the first. I don't claim that this implentation is
%   the best approach, but it will have to do for now. The function returns
%   a data struture that for a NURBS curve contains the first derivatives of
%   the B-Spline representation. Remember that a NURBS curve is represent by
%   a univariate B-Spline using the homogeneous coordinates.
%   The derivative data structure can be evaluated later with the function
%   nrbdeval.
% 
% Examples:
% 
%   See the function nrbdeval for an example.
