%SQRTN    Square root of a scalar by Newton's method.
%         X = SQRTN(A,TOL) computes the square root of the scalar
%         A by Newton's method (also known as Heron's method).
%         A is assumed to be >= 0.
%         TOL is a convergence tolerance (default EPS).
%         [X,ITER] = SQRTN(A,TOL) returns also the number of
%         iterations ITER for convergence.
