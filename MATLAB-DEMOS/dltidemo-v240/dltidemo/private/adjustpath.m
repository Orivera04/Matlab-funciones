function adjustpath(fname)
%ADJUSTPATH Adjust the Matlab path.
%   ADJUSTPATH(fname) checks that the file fname is on the MATLABPATH
%   in a single location.  Depending on fname the following will occur:
%
%      If the file is not found on Matlab's search path, an error is
%      returned saying the function cannot be found on the search path.
%
%      If the file is found in multiple places on Matlab's search path, 
%      an error is returned.  This serves as a safeguard against multiple
%      installations.
%
%      If the file is found in a single place on Matlab's search path,
%      it is then checked against the MATLABPATH.  The purpose is to 
%      distinguish between a file in the current directory from a file
%      which is truly on the MATLABPATH.  If it truly on the MATLABPATH the 
%      function returns with no error.  If it is not on the MATLABPATH 
%      (which means it must be in the current directory), the user is given 
%      an option to temporarily add the file's path to the the MATLABPATH 
%      for the current Matlab session.  If yes is chosen, it is added.  If 
%      no is chosen, an error is returned saying the file must be on the 
%      path to run.
