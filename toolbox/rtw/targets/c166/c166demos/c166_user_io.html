<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">C166 Integrating Hand-Coded I/O Device Drivers Demo</p>

<p>This demo model and associated documentation explains the steps involved in integrating
your own device driver code. The approach shown involves specifying the model inputs and outputs
as global variables. You can generate code from the controller subsystem, which will automatically download and run on the target.</p>
<p>If you are using a Phytec phyCORE module with HD200 development board, you can see successful execution of the code when the LED blinks. Prior to generating code, you can run this model in closed-loop simulation. If you use this model as a basis for integrating your own device driver code, this closed-loop simulation allows you to validate the correct behavior of your control algorithm before running it in real-time. Follow the links in the model to open the source files for the device driver code; you can use these as a guide for writing your own device drivers. This demo is also used as example to show you how to start your debugger as part of the build process.</p> 

<ol>
<li>To open this model, click the link or at the command line type
<a href="matlab:c166_user_io">c166_user_io
</a>
<li>To generate code and download to the target, right click on the <code>controller</code> subsytem and select <strong>Tools -&gt; Real-Time Workshop -&gt;Build Subsystem</strong>. Click <strong>Build</strong> in the following dialog to continue the code generation process.
<li>Double click the block <strong>Open help for integrating hand code</strong> to see a tutorial explaining this example in detail in the User's Guide, "Integrating Your Own Device Drivers".
