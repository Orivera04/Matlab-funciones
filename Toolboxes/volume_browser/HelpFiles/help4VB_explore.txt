Items in this menu allow different displays of the values in the volume. Except for the default view, an existing view of the volume is generally not deleted if a new display is created (so one could have an iso-display on top of a slice). In order to start from scratch one needs to delete the existing display via "Views" | "Clear figure".

"Explore volume" | "3-D contours"
Creates color-coded contour lines on any number of constant-coordinate slices. Slices for a particular coordinate can be turned on and off by checking/unchecking the boxes near the top of the GUI. By default, the first time this menu item is selected the slice positions are the centers of the respective coordinate ranges, and all coordinates are turned on.

"Explore volume" | "Iso-displays" 
Iso-surfaces creates surfaces at specified iso-surface values.
Iso-normals computes the normals of iso-surfaces; normals point into the direction of smaller data values. 
Iso-caps creates caps in addition to iso-surfaces.
These three options create calls to Matlab functions "isosurface", "isonormals", and "isocaps", respectively. For additional help see the documentation for these functions.

"Explore volume" | "Slices"
Creates any number of color-coded, constant-coordinate slices. Slices for a particular coordinate can be turned on or off by checking/unchecking the boxes near the top of the GUI. By default, the first time this menu item is selected the slice positions are the centers of the respective coordinate ranges, and all coordinates are turned on.
The plot option at the bottom allows one to display all slices for the selected coordinate in one single figure.

"Explore volume" | "Sliceomat" 
Similar to "Slices" but only one slice per axis. The slice positions can be selected via slider bars. 
The animation option at the bottom of the GUI moves the active slices through the volume and saves the display as a movie, if the "Save as a movie" box is checked.
