% odeRK4sysv  Fourth order Runge-Kutta method for systems of first order ODEs
%             Vectorized version with pass-through parameters.
%
% Synopsis:  [t,y] = odeRK4sysv(diffeq,tn,h,y0)
%            [t,y] = odeRK4sysv(diffeq,tn,h,y0,arg1,arg2,...)
%
% Input:     diffeq = (string) name of the m-file that evaluates the right
%                      hand side of the ODE system written in standard form.
%            tn      = stoping value of the independent variable
%            h       = stepsize for advancing the independent variable
%            y0      = vector of the dependent variable values at x = x0
%            arg1,arg2 = list of additional arguments passed through
%                        odeRK4sysv to the ``diffeq'' routine.
%
% Output:    t = vector of independent variable values:  t(j) = x0 + j*h
%            y = matrix of dependent variables values, one column for each
%                state variable.  Each row is from a different time step.

t = (0:h:tn)';           %  Column vector of elements with spacing h
nt = length(t);          %  number of steps (+1 for the initial conditions)

%  Outer loop for all steps:  j = time step index;  k = equation number index

for j=2:nt
