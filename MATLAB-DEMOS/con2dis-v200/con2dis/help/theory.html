<strong>Continuous-Discrete time conversion: (Sampling)</strong><br>

<p align="left">Most of the real world signals that we encounter are continuous
time signals. It is difficult and costly to process signals in continuous time. 
If the continuous time signals can be converted to discrete time signals (sample
values at discrete points) by some reliable method, then computers can be used
to do the processing in discrete time. In most cases, processing discrete time
signals is flexible and preferable, compared to that of continuous time
signals.</p> 

<p align="left">The conversion process should be such that, the information in
continuous time is carried over reliably to the discrete domain and the original
signal can also be reconstructed from its discrete domain value. <span
class="TextHighlight2">Sampling</span> is the process that can be used to
convert the continuous time signal to discrete time signal. If a few conditions
are met, then representing and recovering a continuous time signal from its
samples will be reliable and the <span class="TextHighlight2">Sampling
Theorem</span> specifies these conditions. </p>

<p align="left">In relevance to the <span
class="TextHighlight">Con2Dis</span> tool, we base our discussions on
Sinusoidal signals. Since, most of real-world signals can be represented using
Sinusoidal signals, concepts discussed here can be applied and extended to all
kinds of signals. In this section, we discuss the sampling theorem, requirements
specified by it and the consequences if the theorem is not satisfied.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ctod_block.png"></p>
<p align="left">An ideal system that converts Continuous-time signal to
discrete-time signal is as shown in the figure. Consider a continuous time
sinusoidal signal of the form, </p> 

<p align="center"><img src="images/ip_eqn.png"></p>
 where, <font face="symbol">w</font><sub>0</sub> is the radian frequency (rad)
 of the signal and f<sub>0</sub> is the cyclic frequency (Hz) of the signal.
<p align="left">The corresponding discrete time signal x[n] can be obtained by
sampling x(t), using the ideal system shown above. Hence, x[n] is of the
form,</p> 
<p align="center"><img src="images/ip_dis_eqn.png"></p>

<p align="left">
Thus the sampling operation can be seen as a transformation from Continuous-time
to discrete-time. The system used here is only a mathematical idealization. In
real-world, this needs to be implemented using an A/D converter that has
quantization and jitter problems. We are not concerned about these issues in our
discussion here.</p>

<p align="left">The obtained samples, by themselves cannot be used to reliably
reconstruct the original signal. This is because, more than one continuous-time
signal can have the same discrete-time samples, depending on their own frequency
and sampling frequency. So, in order to reconstruct the signal, we need to know
the sampling rate of the signal. Another information that is of importance is
how often do we need to sample the signal, to reliably reconstruct it. A
condition for this is given by <span class="TextHighlight2">Shannon's Sampling
Theorem</span>, which states that,</p>

<blockquote>
A continuous-time signal <code>x(t)</code> with frequencies no higher than
f<sub>max</sub> can be reconstructed exactly from its samples
<code>x[n]=x(nT<sub>s</sub>)</code>, if the samples are taken at a rate
<code>f<sub>s</sub>=1/T<sub>s</sub></code> that is greater than <code>2f<sub>max</sub></code>.
</blockquote>

<p align="left">f<sub>s</sub> is called the <span
class="TextHighlight2">sampling rate</span> and 2f<sub>max</sub> 
is called the <span class="TextHighlight2">Nyquist Rate</span>. So, from
Sampling theorem, the minimum required sampling rate should be greater than the
Nyquist Rate, for reconstructing the original signal.</p>

<p align="left">We need to examine the case when this condition is not met,
i.e.,What happens if we do not sample fast-enough ? We can consider the
sinusoidal case and see the effect of sampling rate. We begin with a time-domain
approach and later adopt a frequency domain approach, to see the effects of
sampling rate selection. Consider another sinusoidal signal, whose frequency is
f<sub>0</sub>+ <strong><em>l</em></strong> f<sub>s</sub>, which can be
represented as,

<p align="center"><img src="images/alias_eqn.png"></p>

<p align="left">where f<sub>0</sub> is the frequency of the previuos signal
given in Eq.1b and <strong><em>l</em></strong> is an integer. If this signal
is sampled at the same rate as the original signal at a rate f<sub>s</sub>, it
can be shown that the discrete samples y[n] of the new signal and x[n] of the
old signal are the same.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/alias_dis_eqn.png"></p>

<p align="left">Thus, signals with frequencies
f<sub>0</sub>+ <strong><em>l</em></strong>f<sub>s</sub> 
with different integer values of '<strong><em>l</em></strong>' will have the
same samples. By just looking at the samples, the exact signal cannot be
identified, the frequencies
f<sub>0</sub>+<strong><em>l</em></strong>f<sub>s</sub> are called 'aliases' of
the frequency f<sub>0</sub>, with respect to the sampling frequency
f<sub>s</sub>. Similarly, signals with frequency -f<sub>0</sub>+
<strong><em>l</em></strong>f<sub>s</sub> will also have the samples as x[n] when
sampled at sampling frequency f<sub>s</sub>. These are also called <span
class="TextHighlight2">aliases</span> of the original signal with frequency
f<sub>0</sub>. Our task then, is to correctly identify and reconstruct the
original signal. To get a better understanding of these signals, sampling
process and reconstruction we next take a frequency domain approach.</p>

<p align="left">A frequency spectrum view of the above signals will give better
insight into the frequency of the signal and the corresponding aliases. As
suggested by Sampling Theorem, if the signal is sampled at a frequency greater
than twice the signal frequency, problems due to aliasing can be avoided. In
this case the original signal frequency f<sub>0</sub> lies within the range 0
and f<sub>s</sub> /2. Similarly, the symmetric component -f<sub>0</sub> lies
within the range 0 and -f<sub>s</sub> /2. So, if we use the components that lie
in the range -f<sub>s</sub>/2 and +f<sub>s</sub>/2, the original signal can be
reconstructed.</p>

<p align="left">If on the other hand, the signal is sampled at a rate
f<sub>s</sub> <font face="symbol"> &lt </font> f<sub>0</sub>, then aliasing
occurs. i.e the original signal cannot be reconstructed from the frequency
components in the range f<sub>s</sub>/2 and +f<sub>s</sub>/2. This is because;
the frequency component in the specified range corresponds to a signal of much
lower frequency f<sub>0</sub>-f<sub>s</sub>. The original frequency component
f<sub>0</sub> lies outside the range -f<sub>s</sub>/2 to +f<sub>s</sub>/2 .</p>

<p align="left">Both these cases are illustrated in the example given below.</p>

<p align="left">So far, we have discussed the process of converting Continuous
time signal to a Discrete time signal. In the next section, we give a brief
introduction to the process of reconstruction, i.e., conversion from Discrete to
Continuous time signal.</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Discrete-Continuous time conversion: (Reconstruction)</strong><br>

<p align="left">
In the previous sections, we have considered the transformation of continuous
time signals into discrete time signals. In this section, we consider the
reverse process. This is referred as 'Reconstruction'.  If the sampled sequence
was obtained by sampling at a rate specified by sampling theorem (f<sub>0</sub>
< f<sub>s</sub>/2), then we should be able to reconstruct the original
signal. For the simple case of sinusoid signals, reconstruction is just
substituting n by f<sub>s</sub>t. If on the other hand f<sub>0</sub> >
f<sub>s</sub>/2, then the reconstructed signal is an alias of the original
signal. An ideal D-C converter is as shown in the figure.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/dtoc_block.png"></p>

<p align="left">In the general case, reconstruction is achieved through
interpolation. The general form of reconstruction by D-C converters is given
as,<br> 
<p align="center"><img src="images/recons_eqn.png"></p>

where, p(t) is the pulse shape of the D-C (Digital to Continuous) converter. The
pulse can be either a square pulse, triangular pulse or 'sinc'. As seen from the
equation, the output signal is obtained by adding time-shifted pulses at the
instants specified by the discrete samples obtained by sampling. Each term
y[n]p(t-nT<sub>s</sub>) in the sum will create a region of amplitude y[n]
centered at t=nT<sub>s</sub>. At points in between two samples, components from
many pulses add up to provide the intermediate values of y(t). For ideal
reconstruction, a 'sinc' pulse can be used, because of its infinite length and
narrow bandwidth. The 'sinc' pulse is represented by the equation,<br> 
<p align="center"><img src="images/sinc_eqn.png"></p>

If sampling theorem was satisfied during the sampling process, then a sinusoid
can be reconstructed exactly using a 'sinc' pulse. </p>

<p align="left">In the case of the <span class="TextHighlight">Con2Dis</span>
tool, we consider sinusoids and hence reconstruction is by replacing
<code>n</code> with <code>f<sub>s</sub>t</code>. If aliasing had occurred, then
the aliased frequency is used in reconstruction, and the original signal is
lost. </p>

In this section we have a given a brief introduction to the concept of sampling
and reconstruction, in relevance to the Continuous-Discrete Sampling
tool. Please refer to standard texts, for a more detailed explanation on these
concepts. Next, section discusses some examples, to illustrate concepts
discussed in this section.

<p align="left"> In this section, we provide examples that illustrate the use of
<span class="TextHighlight">Con2Dis</span> tool in visualizing effects of
sampling.</p>

<strong>Oversampling: </strong><br>
<p align="left">In this case, we sample the input signal at a rate higher than
the Nyquist rate, to avoid aliasing. The input signal frequency is 12Hz and has
zero phase. By sampling theorem, we require a sampling rate greater than
2*f<sub>0</sub> i.e., 24Hz. The maximum allowable sampling frequency in the tool
is 30Hz and so we set that as the sampling frequency. Once the signal and
sampling frequency have been set, you should be able to identify them from the
spectrum plots. </p>

<p align="left">In the <strong>Continuous Time Spectrum</strong> plot at the
bottom left, the 'yellow' band indicates the range of -f<sub>s</sub>/2 to
+f<sub>s</sub>/2. The 'blue' stem plots indicate the signal frequency. So, from
this plot we can see that the sampling frequency is more than twice the input
frequency. This means there should be no Aliasing.</p>

<p align="left">In the Discrete Time plot, after sampling, the normalized
frequency of the signal is f/f<sub>s</sub>. Corresponding to the input signal
frequency and sampling frequency, there are other aliased frequencies
f<sub>0</sub>+ <strong><em>l</em></strong>f<sub>s</sub> for
<strong><em>l</em></strong>=1,2... These are indicated in the <strong>Discrete
Time Spectrum</strong> as 'red' stem plots. As can be seen from the spectrum,
these aliases are outside the -f<sub>s</sub>/2 to +f<sub>s</sub>/2 range. Hence,
these aliased frequencies will not be used in reconstructing the original
signal.</p>

<p align="left">The parameters used in this example are, <br><blockquote>
&nbsp;<em>Input signal frequency: f<sub>0</sub> </em>= 12.0 Hz,
&nbsp;<em>Minimum required sampling frequency </em>> 24.0 Hz <br> 
&nbsp;<em>Sampling frequency: f<sub>s</sub></em> = 30.0 Hz,
&nbsp;<em>Discrete domain (Normalized) frequency: f<sub>0</sub> / f<sub>s</sub>
</em>= 0.40<br>
&nbsp;<em>Output signal frequency</em> = 12.0 Hz. (No Aliasing)
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img src="images/oversampled.png"></p>

<p align="left">The plots on the top and bottom right of the figure, display the
reconstructed output signal and its spectrum. Here, ideal reconstruction was
used and further since the input was a sinusoid, we can directly substitute n
with f<sub>s</sub>t.</p> 

<strong>Under-Sampling:</strong> <br>
<p align="left"> Let us next consider the case where the input signal is sampled
at a rate less than the Nyquist rate (2f<sub>0</sub>). i.e., f<sub>s</sub> can
be either less than f<sub>0</sub> or less than 2f<sub>0</sub>. We use the same
input signal frequency of 12Hz. If the input is sampled at 14Hz, which is less
than the Nyquist rate, then the output signal is aliased. From the
<strong>Continuous Time Spectrum</strong>, it can be seen that the input signal
frequency component lies outside the frequency range -f<sub>s</sub>/2 to
+f<sub>s</sub>/2 (-7 to +7).</p>

<p align="left">In the following illustration, Normalized frequencies are used,
as the Con2Dis tool, uses this in labeling the <strong>Discrete Time
spectrum</strong>. As seen from the Discrete time spectrum, instead of the
original frequency f<sub>0</sub>/f<sub>s</sub>(.86, -.86), aliases
f<sub>0</sub>-f<sub>s</sub>/f<sub>s</sub> (-.14),
f<sub>s</sub>-f<sub>0</sub>/f<sub>s</sub> (.14) 
of the input frequency lie within the range. This aliases corresponds to a
frequency of 2Hz. So, when this component is used in the reconstruction, the
output signal is not the original signal. Instead its an alias of the original
signal. Thus, we see that the original signal is lost if the sampling rate is
less than that specified by the Sampling theorem.</p>

<p align="left">The parameters used in this example are, <br><blockquote>
&nbsp;<em>Input signal frequency: f<sub>0</sub> </em>= 12.0 Hz,
&nbsp;<em>Minimum required sampling frequency </em>> 24.0 Hz <br> 
&nbsp;<em>Sampling frequency: f<sub>s</sub></em> = 14.0 Hz,
&nbsp;<em>Discrete domain (Normalized) frequency: f<sub>0</sub> / f<sub>s</sub>
</em>= 0.86<br> 
&nbsp;<em>Aliased frequency (Normalized) = |f<sub>0</sub>-f<sub>s</sub> /
f<sub>s</sub></em>| = 0.14,
&nbsp;<em>Output signal frequency</em> = 2.0 Hz. (Aliased)
