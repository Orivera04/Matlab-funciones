<p>This demonstration shows how to trimi and linearize within Simulink to generate
linear models of an airframe.</p> 

<h4>Demonstration Background</h4>
<p>Designing the autopilot using classical design techniques
requires linear models of the airframe pitch dynamics for a number of trimmed
flight conditions. MATLAB can determine the trim conditions and derive linear
state-space models directly from the nonlinear Simulink and Aerospace Blockset
model. This saves time and helps to validate the model. The functions provided 
by the Control System Toolbox allows you to visualize the behavior of the 
airframe in terms of open-loop frequency (or time) responses.</p>

<h4>Running the Demonstration</h4>
<p>Double-click on the yellow block at the bottom of the Simulink diagram
to run an M-script that describes on these commands are used.</p>

<h4>Demonstration Output</h4>
<p>The output from this demo is a Bode diagram in the Control
System Toolbox viewer.</p>
