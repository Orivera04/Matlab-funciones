<p>Hopefully, a person could start using the MATLAB convolution tool without any need to
read these help files.&nbsp; Features were designed to be intuitive and familiar to those
with basic computer experience. <small><em>If not send me mail by clicking on my name in the Overview section!!</em></small></p>

<p>For those who like to read the manual (don't be ashamed, I am one of these people),
this section will give you the minimum you need to get started and be comfortable with the
use of the GUI.</p>

<p>First, if you have not already done so, follow the information given in the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Installation</SPAN> section to install and start the MATLAB convolution tool.</p>

<p>To begin, pick an input signal and an impulse response: 

<ol>
  <li>Press the <strong>Get x(t)</strong> button in the main window.&nbsp; A second window
    should open with a pulse signal displayed.&nbsp; If you wish, alter the signal type using
    the list box at the top of the window, and alter the signal parameters with the controls along
    the right side.&nbsp; Note that time parameters for the <strong>sine</strong> and 
    <strong>cosine</strong> (<strong>length</strong>, <strong>period</strong>, 
    <strong>delay</strong>) must be specified in seconds.&nbsp When satisfied click the 
    <strong>OK</strong> button.&nbsp; The signal you picked is now displayed within the     
    <strong>Input</strong> plot box.<br>
    <br>
    <em><small>Note:&nbsp; The signal may not be fully displayed when changing the signal
    parameters.&nbsp; To replot the signal, click inside the plot box.</small><br>
    <br>
    </em></li>
    <li>Make sure the <strong>Flip h(t)</strong> radio button is checked and then pick an
    impulse response by pressing the <strong>Get h(t)</strong> button.&nbsp; After choosing
    an impulse response and closing the window, the three large axes will now contain the
    following information:<br>
    <br>
    - The top axis displays the <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Input</SPAN> signal
    in blue and flipped version of the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Impulse Response</SPAN>
    in red.<br>
    <br>
    - The middle axis shows the multiplication of the <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Input</SPAN> 
    signal and <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Impulse Response</SPAN> at that particular instance of 
    time.&nbsp; (This may initially be empty.)<br>
    <br>
    - The bottom axis shows the output of the linear convolution between the <SPAN 
    class="TextHighlight2">Input</SPAN> signal and the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Impulse 
    Response</SPAN> signal.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are two labels with arrows pointing to the current time.&nbsp; One is below the 
    <strong>Signal / Flipped Signal</strong> plot box.&nbsp; The other is above the 
    <strong>Output</strong> plot box.&nbsp; Move the mouse over either of these.&nbsp; The mouse 
    pointer should become a hand symbol indicating that the current time can be changed by dragging 
    the <strong>t</strong> time label.<br>
    <br>
    Go ahead and drag the time label around to change the value of the current index
    location.&nbsp; Quite a few things happen: The <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Flipped Impulse
    Response</SPAN> follows the location of the time location, and the 
    <strong>multiplication</strong> plot changes depending on the relative overlap between the 
    <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Input</SPAN> signal and the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Flipped         
    Impulse Response</SPAN>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Change the time so that the two signals overlap in the <strong>Signal / Flipped 
    Signal</strong> window.  There will now be a nonzero plot within the 
    <strong>multiplication</strong> axis.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the current time is highlighted in the <strong>Output</strong> plot.&nbsp; The 
    numeric value (i.e., the value on the y axis) of this time is determined by integrating the 
    area within the <strong>multiplication</strong> plot.<br>
    <br>
    Ex.&nbsp; If the signals overlapped so that the <strong>multiplication</strong> plot
    integrated to a value of 6, the highlighted value in the <strong>output</strong> plot would     
    have a value of 6.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it!&nbsp; You now understand the basics of how to use the MATLAB convolution
tool.&nbsp; For a more in depth description of convolution theory and how a convolution is
calculated see the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Theory</SPAN> section.&nbsp; The <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Controls</SPAN> and <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Menus</SPAN>
sections provide a description of all the elements in the user interface.</p>
