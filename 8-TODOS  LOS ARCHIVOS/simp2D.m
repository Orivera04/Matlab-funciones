% function out = simpY('func',a,b,c,d,NX,NY)
% func(x,y) returns the 2D function to be integrated at argument x and y
% a and b are x limits of integration, c and d are y limits of integration
% NX number of x intervals, NY number of y intervals
% note: NX, NY should be even but program fixes this if not.
% WARNING: ensure that func(x,y) is `vector-enabled', i.e.
% can handle vectors correctly, otherwise misleading results
% may be obtained. This code is fully vectorized for speed.

% The 2D simpson's integrator has weights that are most easily determined 
% by taking the outer product of the vector of weights for the 1D simpson's
% rule. For example let's say we have the vector (1 4 2 4 2 4 1) for 6 intervals.
% In 2D we now get an array of weights that is given by:
%    | 1  4  2  4  2  4  1 |
%    | 4 16  8 16  8 16  4 |
%    | 2  8  4  8  4  8  2 |
%    | 4 16  8 16  8 16  4 |
%    | 2  8  4  8  4  8  2 |
%    | 4 16  8 16  8 16  4 |
%    | 1  4  2  4  2  4  1 |
%
% Notice how the usual 1D simpson's weights appear around the sides of the array

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Examples:
% A) Integrate cos(x^2 + y^2) over the region 0 <= x <=1, 0 <= y <= 1
% Set
% func = @(x,y) cos(x.^2 + y.^2) Note this is vector enabled
% ans = simp2D(func,0,1,0,1,512,512)
% 
% B) Determine the area of a circle of radius 1.
% 
% Set up an m file and define a function as follows:
%
% function z = myfun2D(x,y)
%
% zloc = x.^2 + y.^2;
% L = zloc <= 1;
% zmask = zeros(size(x));
% zmask(L) = 1;
% z = zmask;
%
% ans = simp2D('myfun2D',-1,1,-1,1,512,512)
%
% Note you lose accuracy on curved regions at least O(h) than for regular
% regions.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

% Ensure the number of intervals is even!
NX = 2*ceil(NX/2);
NY = 2*ceil(NY/2);

% Set up the integration step sizes in the x and y directions
hx = (b - a)/NX;
hy = (d - c)/NY;

% define grid vectors
xg = a:hx:b;
yg = c:hy:d;
[xxg yyg] = ndgrid(xg,yg);

% Note that the ndgrid routine is only included inside simp2D to make it
% self-contained. If you were using simp inside a loop, it would be better to
% calculate the vectors and ndgrid step outside the function and pass xxg, yyg
% and a, b, c, d as globals say. This can save 25% in run time in large loops.
% For single use or small loops the penalty is small.

% Now set up a matrix U that contains the values of the function evaluated at all
% points on the 2D grid setup by xg and yg.

U = feval(func,xxg,yyg);

% Evaluate the contribution from the corner points first.
% These all have weight 1. NB U(1,1) corresponds to func(a,b) etc.

s1 = ( U(1,1) + U(1,NY+1) + U(NX+1,1) + U(NX+1,NY+1) );

% Now sum the contributions from the terms along each edge not including
% corners. There are 4 edges in the 2D case that contribute to the sum
% and we have points with weight 4 and points with weight 2. Points
% with weight 4 are acessed by indices 2:2:N (N=NX,NY,NZ), while points with
% weight 2 are accessed by indices 3:2:N-1.

% Define vectors of odd and even indices for each direction:

ixo = 2:2:NX;
ixe = 3:2:NX-1;
iyo = 2:2:NY;
iye = 3:2:NY-1;

s2 = 2*( sum(U(1,iye)) + sum(U(NX+1,iye)) + sum(U(ixe,1)) + sum(U(ixe,NY+1)) );
s3 = 4*( sum(U(1,iyo)) + sum(U(NX+1,iyo)) + sum(U(ixo,1)) + sum(U(ixo,NY+1)) );


% Now we look at the remaining contributions on the interior grid points. 
% Looking at our array example above we see that there
% are only 3 different weights viz. 16, 8 and 4. Some thought will show that
% using our definitions above for odd and even gridpoints, that weight 16 is
% only found at points (xodd, yodd), weight 4 is found at points (xeven,yeven)
% while weight 8 is found at both (xodd,yeven) or (xeven,yodd).


% Our contribution from interior points is then

s4 = 16*sum( sum( U(ixo,iyo) ) ) + 4*sum( sum( U(ixe,iye) ) );
s5 =  8*sum( sum( U(ixe,iyo) ) ) + 8*sum( sum( U(ixo,iye) ) );

% Finally add all the contributions and multiply by the step sizes hx, hy and 
% a factor 1/9 (1/3 in each direction).


out = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5;
out = out*hx*hy/9.0;
