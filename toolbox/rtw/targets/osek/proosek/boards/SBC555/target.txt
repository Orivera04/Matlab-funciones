Notes for operating the EVB555 evaluation board 
===============================================

Running from internal flash:

To run from internal flash you have to place all code and constant
data within the address range 0x000000 - 0x06ffff. Execution after
reset will start at address 0x100.

Consult your BDM software´s documentation on how to program the
flash memory of the MPC555.

The factory settings should be suitable for running code out of
internal flash. As long as only the internal RAM is used, no
additional hardware initializations should be needed and the
startup code can directly be located to address 0x100.

Consult the EVB555 quick reference to find out about problems
booting from internal flash with old versions of the MPC555.


Running from external RAM:

While developing using a BDM you can execute the code from external
RAM on the EVB555 board. It is possible to compile and link your
application the same way as for internal flash.

Before loading the code into RAM you must disable the FLEN bit
(either by setting the corresponding dip switch 20 of the hard
reset configuration to zero or by disabling the bit in the IMMR
using your BDM software). Then, disable CS0 and activate CS1
(e.g. write 0x00000002 to 0x2fc100 and 0x00000003 to 0x2fc108).

Now, the external RAM should be accessible from address 0 and the
application can be downloaded and run using BDM.


Performance considerations:

To get the optimal performance you should:

- run code from internal flash only
- use only internal RAM
- increase the PLL multiplication factor (by default the MPC555
  on the EVB555 runs only at 20MHz)
- disconnect the BDM interface
- set the CPU core to normal mode and turn off show cylces
  (set ISCT_SER in the ICTRL register to 111)
