   ADVANCED MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS
       APPLICATIONS USING MATLAB
         Edition 3, July 2002

This program library has thirteen directories
corresponding to MATLAB solutions in the book
'Advanced Mathematics and Mechanics Applications
Using MATLAB', 3rd Ed., CRC Press, 2002. The 
authors are Howard Wilson, Louis Turcotte, and
David Halpern. Sixty-seven programs composed of
about twelve thousand lines of code are included.
Some MATLAB utility functions are repeated in
more that one directory so that each directory
is an independent collection. The chapter titles
are:
1.  Introduction
2.  Elementary Aspects of MATLAB Graphics
3.  Summary of Concepts from Linear Algebra
4.  Methods for Interpolation and Numerical 
    Differentiation
5.  Gauss Integration with Geometric Property
    Applications
6.  Fourier Series and the Fast Fourier Transform
7.  Dynamic Response of Linear Second Order Systems
8.  Integration of Nonlinear Initial Value Porblems
9.  Boundary Value Problems for Partial 
    Differential Equations
10. Eigenvalue Problems and Applications
11. Bending Analysis of Beams of General Cross
    Section
12. Applicatons of Analytic functions
13. Nonlinear Optimization Applications
