MATLAB software for Iterative Methods for Linear and Nonlinear Equations

by C. T. Kelley

These M-files are implementations of the algorithms from the book
"Iterative Methods for Linear and Nonlinear Equations", SIAM Frontiers no16,
by C. T. Kelley. The book, which describes the algorithms, is available
from SIAM (service@siam.org). These files can be modified for non-commercial
purposes provided that I am acknowledged and clear comment lines are inserted
that the code has been changed. I assume no no responsibility
for any errors that may exist in these routines.
