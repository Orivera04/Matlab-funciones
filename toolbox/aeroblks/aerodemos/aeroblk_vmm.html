freedom Variable Mass Missile Airframe</p>

<p>This demonstration shows how to simulate Six-degrees-of-freedom variable 
mass equations of motion with Simulink and Aerospace Blockset. </p> 

<p>This demonstration has been color coded to aid in locating Aerospace Blockset
blocks. The medium blue blocks are Aerospace Blockset blocks, the light blue 
blocks are subsystems containing additional Aerospace Blockset blocks and the 
white blocks are Simulink blocks.

<h4>Demonstration Background</h4>

<p>When simulated, this demonstration shows the expected tumbling of an 
uncontrolled missile. If the aerodynamic force and moment contributions are 
zeroed, a standard projectile path, discussed in first year Physics classes, can
be seen. </p> 

<p>This demonstration assumes a neutral end burning solid motor for propulsion
and includes rudimentary aerodynamics for the missile body. Fin aerodynamics 
and other fin contribution are neglected.
