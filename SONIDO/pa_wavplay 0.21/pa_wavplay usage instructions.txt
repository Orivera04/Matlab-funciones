
To play audio:
pa_wavplay(buffer, [samplerate], [deviceid], [devicetype]);

To record audio:
inputbuffer = pa_wavrecord(channels, nsamples, [samplerate], [deviceid], [devicetype]);

To play and record audio simultaneously:
inputbuffer = pa_wavplayrecord(playbuffer,[playdevice],[samplerate], [recnsamples], [recchannels], [recdevice],[devicetype])
