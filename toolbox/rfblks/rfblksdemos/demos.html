<p><a href="matlab:amp_qam16"><img src="rfblocks_image.gif" width="400" 
height="300" border="0" align="right"></a>The RF Blockset is a collection 
of behavioral blocks for design, analysis, and simulation of RF components and systems. 

It provides rich capabilities for modeling and analyzing RF systems in the time 
domain by using a solid simulation technique:  baseband equivalent behavioral 
modeling of RF components.  In comparison to traditional circuit simulation tools, 
the RF Blockset executes very rapidly by sampling signals in proportion to the 
symbol rate, not the carrier rate.

The RF Blockset offers a wide variety of RF component blocks like ladder 
filters, transmission lines, black box elements, amplifiers and mixers, and 
enables you to assemble RF subsystems rapidly and efficiently. The RF Blockset 
brings the full power of Simulink<sup class="trademark">&reg;</sup> model-based 
design to RF circuits and systems.</p>
