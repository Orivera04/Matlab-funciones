  myDistFit.m               Distribution fit for energy usage (auto-generated)
  plotCI.m                  Plot of confidence intervals
  plotEstimate.m            Plot of energy demand for particular days (for GUI)

  GUIicons.mat              Icons for the GUI

  January.xls               Historical energy usage data

demo/html Folder:
  MATLAB published version of EnergyForecastAnalysis.m. To view, open 
    EnergyForecastAnalysis.html in a web browser.

You should step through EnergyForecastAnalysis.m in cell execution mode so that
you can see the results in a sequence shown in the webinar on May 25, 2007.
To enable cell mode, first open the M-file by typing "edit EnergyForecastAnalysis"
at the MATLAB command prompt.  Once the editor opens, go to the "Cell" menu
and select "Enable Cell Mode".  Once cell mode is enabled, you can right-click
within each cell (cells begin with %%) and select "Evaluate Current Cell".

This script is commented such that it produces a detailed report if you 
publish it (original in downloaded HTML folder).  This report includes 
background information, a description of what the code is doing, code 
samples, figures, and an analysis of the results.  To publish the M-file, 
go to the "File" menu within the editor and "Publish To" your desired file 
format.
