function profData = profile_mpc555(connection)
% PROFILE_MPC555 collects and displays execution profiling data from an MPC555 target
%    PROFILE_MPC555(CONNECTION) collects and displays execution profiling data
%    from an MPC555 target microcontroller that is running a suitably configured
%    application generated by Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555.
%
%    The CONNECTION may be set to 'CAN' in order to collect data via a CAN
%    connection between the target and the host computer, or 'SERIAL' to
%    collect the data via a serial connection.
%
%    To use the CAN connection, you must have suitable CAN hardware
%    installed. This function will test for availability of CanCardX 1 or
%    CanAc2Pci1 and defaults to a bit rate of 500k bits per second.  
%
%    To use the serial connection, the MPC555 board must be connected via a
%    serial cable to one of the host computer's serial ports.  This
%    function defaults to port SCI1 on the MPC555 and port COM1 on the host
%    computer, at a bit rate of 57600 baud.
%
%    If you need to use a configuration different to these defaults, you
%    should make a copy of this file and change the configuration data as
%    required. The data collected is unpacked then displayed in a summary
%    HTML report and as MATLAB graphic.
%
%    To configure a model for use with execution profiling, you must must
%    perform the following steps: 1) check the appropriate option in the
%    Target Specific Options tab of the Real-Time Workshop Options dialog,
%    2) make sure the model includes a MPC555 Execution Profiling block
%    that provides an interface between the target-side profiling engine,
%    and the host-side computer from which this command is run.
%
%    PROFDATA = PROFILE_MPC555(CONNECTION) returns the execution profiling
%    data in the format documented by EXPROFILE_UNPACK.
