<p>This demonstration shows the Wright Brother's 1903 Flyer modeled in Simulink and
Aerospace Blockset.  This model simulates the longitudinal motion of the Flyer in response
to the pitch commands of a simulated pilot.</p> 

<h4>Demonstration Background</h4>

<p>December 17, 2003 marks the centennial of the first powered, heavier-than-air controlled 
flight.  This first flight happened at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903 
at 10:30 am.  With a flight lasting only 12 seconds and traveling a distance of 120 feet, 
Orville Wright piloted his way into flight history.  Three other flights occurred that 
day with Wilbur and Orville taking turns at the controls.  Each of the flights was of 
increasing distance.  The fourth and final flight of the day completed by Wilbur was an 
impressive 59 seconds traveling 852 feet.  The 1903 Flyer would not take to the skies 
again.  After the last flight of the day, the Flyer was damaged beyond repair when it 
was caught by a gust of wind and rolled over.</p>
