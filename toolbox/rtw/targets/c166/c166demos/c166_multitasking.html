<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Multi-tasking and task
execution profiling</p>

<p>This model illustrates the multi-tasking scheduler and the task execution
profiler. It has been configured to load the processor such that task
pre-emption occurs. You can download and run this model, then run <code>profile_c166</code>
to upload execution profiling data and present the results.</p> The execution profiling shows the behavior when a slower timer-based task is pre-empted by a faster one.

<ol>
<li>To open this model, click the link or at the command line type
