Matlab GUI for playing around with graphs: (Initial Release)
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a stand alone MATLAB GUI / app for graph theory functionality in MATLAB. 
These functions are also used by the STB (software testbed) application. I have the 
MATLAB path pointing to this folder on the local computer so these functions are 
always accessible. If you choose not to do this, please make sure and add the path 
when MATLAB is run else it will produce errors.

To use:
-------
1] Presumably the file has been unzipped to 'path to folder/Graphs_releaseDate'

2] Run MATLAB, go the 'path to folder/Graphs_releaseDate' and add it to matlab path as follows:
	- At matlab prompt type:   >> p = pwd;
	- Now invoke updatePath.m: >> upatePath(p);
	- It should say that the correct path has been added

3] Run makeGraph; and a GUI should pop up for making graphs.

UPDATE: 8/26/04
1] The random graph functionality wasn't quite right, this has been fixed.
2] Some more functionality was also added to getEdges.m, please see comments in file for more info

UPDATE: 11/9/04
1] Better documentation and the previous version had a debugging command I forgot to remove 
but was pointed out by a user -- thanks Tyler!
2] Software is now version controlled, see individual files for updates
