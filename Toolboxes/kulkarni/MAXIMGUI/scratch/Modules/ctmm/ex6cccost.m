% Returns cost rate column vector where c(i)=cost rate when there are i calls in the system

%         M = Number of reservation clerks;
%         H = Number of calls that can be put on hold;
%         r = revenue generated by an accepted call
%         h = cost of putting one call on hold for one unit of time.
