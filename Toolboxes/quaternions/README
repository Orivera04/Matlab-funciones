It is recommended that you leave this package in a separate directory
and add that directory to your matlab path in your startup.m file.
For example, on a unix system, you could use the following commands:

  home=getenv('HOME');
  path([home, '/matlab/quaternions'], path);

See the help info for the MATLAB "path" command for more info.

DO NOT add the unit test subdirectory (quaternions/test) to your path,
as that is only meant to be run to verify the correctness of the
quaternions toolbox.  If you want to run the unit tests, cd to the
quaternions/test directory while running MATLAB.
