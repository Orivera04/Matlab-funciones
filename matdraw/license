MatDraw is Copyright (c) 1997 by Keith Rogers

Version 1, uploaded to the Mathworks FTP server in December
1994, is still freeware and as such may be used and distributed
freely.

Version 5, of which this file is a part, is SHAREWARE, and 
as such may be distributed freely (NOT for profit) and used
for a trial period of 30 days free of charge, but after that
time must be registered.  The registration fee is $10/user
on UNIX machines, $10/machine for single user PC's.  The number
of users on a UNIX machine is the same as the number of users
for that machine's Matlab license.  A multi-user license for
10-50 users is $100, and an unlimited user site license is
$200.  Registration entitles the user to free updates and 
technical support (English or Japanese) via e-mail.
