function ftbstartdate()
%
%START DATE refers to the date upon which a bond actually starts (i.e. the
%date from which a bond's cash flows can be considered). This date can be
%specified as a future date so as to make an instrument forward starting.
%
% Note:  In Financial Toolbox 2.0, the StartDate input is inactive
% in ACCRFRAC, CFAMOUNTS, CFTIMES, BNDPRICE, BNDYIELD, BNDDURP,
% BNDDURY, BNDCONVP, and BNDCONVY.  The input argument is listed in
% these functions for forward compatibility.
