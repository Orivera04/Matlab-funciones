function w=pw(a,x)
%       ===================================================================
%       Purpose: Compute parabolic cylinder function W(a,x)
%       Input  : a --- Parameter (|a| < 5)
%                x --- Argument (|x| < 5)
%       Output : w ------ W(a,x)                
%       Routine called:
%               'cgamma' for computing complex Gamma function
%       ===================================================================

%  This program was inspired by the Matlab program 'specfun' (author 
%  B. Barrowes) which is a direct conversion by 'f2matlab' (author
%  B. Barrowes) of the corresponding Fortran program in 
%  S. Zhang and J. Jin, 'Computation of Special functions' (Wiley, 1966).
