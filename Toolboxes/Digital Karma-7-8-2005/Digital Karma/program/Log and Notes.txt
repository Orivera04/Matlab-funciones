Digital Karma Log
all tools for both click & shift-click, go slowly step by step starting from the tool selection in GUI
animation
update help
  compare detailed, 1st state is primary the state who's values are displayed after compare, not last entered
  rotation, decided not to adapt mouselocation, selection and gridlines. Stuff kept coming up
    for a rarely used tool.  Use just for change in perspective.
1/04/05, made the choosers run seperate files for easier editing, added CA 37 to one D
1/05/05, made the rules regular files whose file name equals rule, Can edit files with new edit command, Added file for custom rules, added save state as a jpg, added none to tools list for turning all off although not really necessary
1/07/05, made rules wrap around, added CA 37, 37R & game of life wrap seperate from non-wrap, button_up glitch fixed
1/21/05, help file written for others
1/24/05, added scale for range to change how many color variations, if range is much bigger than default was adjacent different number would have same color, now slightly different
1/26/05, removed flashing by switching to image!, added print, added output box, made my own mouseover which shows the cell the row's binary equivalent and the entire row
1/27/05, added state loader
1/30/05; fixed scale display
1/31/05, integrated binary state comparison, added average3 2007 & 1599, added base3 comparison, now converts row to from appropriate base, made state comparison work for any base
2/01/05, made state comparer check number range of both compared states, it also verifies the comparing states are the same size, added size limit for history!, removed no 2D history, started avi creation but one error still, started a multi-state comparison
2/07/05, added crop function, added to help file, added delete iterations function
2/08/05, completed multi-state comparison, wroked on removing zoomed in outside of image click changer bug, added row & col(in addition to iteration) to 2-D crop
2/09/05, added Rule 90,added find & replace tool, optimized 2-state find using new find info(didn't convert multi-state too much work),improved help, Save now gives a dialog box to enter a customizable name, It inputs the current time and date as a default name, worked on avi click changer zoomed in bug and using sub-folders but non were successful
2/11/05, 2/10--2/11 added a dynamic zeros insertion to graph top and removed permantent insertion based on rows, rows can now dynamically change & a isn't polluted with the zeros, rows can be changed during an iteration
2/13/05, added multi undo for changer, didn't add for others since didn't think you'd be multi deleting iterations or croping, removed undo safety feature canceling undo after iterations were continued since unnecessary since returns entire "a" to before change and not just that cell keeping post iterations which would be bad
2/14/05, made 2-D initial command lineable, no requires you to load 2-D initial from excel manual so you have the option of using command line, changed completed iterations calculation and display box to keep constant when limiting iterations saved, adjusted help file to match
2/17/05, made one undo for everything, added redo, started selection tool
2/18/05, graphical selection of cells for both dimensions!, changed crop to use graphical selection, display selected values option added, find inside selection added, added currently iterating display box
2/19/05, added copy & paste of selection, changed delete iterations to work with selection, added delete rows and columns and insert rows and columns and iterations using History Unchangeable option,
2/20/05, added paste into new state, multi-copy but no multi paste, added compare selections
2/21/05, added move tool, fixed find
2/23/05, implemented adjustable rows & columns,
2/24/05, zoom works!, adjusted everything found so far for new setup, undo & redo keep columnsshown & rowsshown
2/25/05, improved Display Values, export expanded to a b and aselection, load calculates row/column info, Pan!, added rule generation for nearest neighbor 2 color, nearest totalistic 3 color, nearest neighbor reversible 2 color, next nearest totalistic 2 color, nearest totalistic 4 color, game of life 2D nearest neighbor totalistic 2 color with stay same option, improved delete iterations slightly
2/26/05, added any number of colors/cell values to rule generators
2/27/05, improved speed of rule generators
2/28/05, added load & save rule/colors
3/02/05, added toolbar
3/09/05, lots of little improvements I didn't want to record, added autoscale
3/10/05, wrote matrix2num and num2matrix script
3/11/05, DigitalKarma works better with Structures now!!, rearrange code somewhat, added base 10 eauivalent of selection, added byte tool for converting any byte size to a base 10 number with a mouse over on graph, changer works now for structures, made seperate find for structures, limited to one logical operator
3/14/05, fixed comparison tool errors, made detailed comparison multi state/selection, find can now replace the found values * 2 or finding(1,2)
3/18/05, adjusted the tools so byte & move are integrated, setup for future selection shift-click & mouseover display addins
3/20/05, changed all tools to selection shift-click,
3/21/05, formalized structure #
3/22/05, reorganized analysis some menus & files,
3/24/05, added auto select
3/30/05, limited matrix2num's output to 16 digits.  OVer that it ouputs NaN so I don't get involved with the rounding error
3/31/05, added currently graphed to auto select,
4/01/05, made the selection only draw the part currently graph & not calculate drawing a bunch of points off the graph, which takes a while for large selections
4/02/05, load state improved, added basic stats
4/04/05, added FindandSelect!!
4/05/05, added Matrix to FindandSelect, combined FindandSelect with FindandReplace, combined FindMatrix and FindValue, One simple awesome find!!
4/06/05, worked on multi-dimension_transpose
4/07/05, finished multi_dimension_transpose, replaced three_dimension_transpose with mult_dimension since both very fast
4/08/05, structure(pattern)search works for any dimensions and with advanced search options!
4/09/05, structure search made faster by only checking forwards
4/14/05, fixed load in comparison bug
4/19/05, used nearest neighbor code to simplify reversible neighbor & speed up a bit
5/04/05, added multiple windows
5/06/05, made undo work with multiple windows
5/07/05, changed zoomoff to zoombackward and made it work with multiple windows
5/19/05, added direction rotation and decided not to adapt mouselocation, selection and gridlines, using just for perspective change
