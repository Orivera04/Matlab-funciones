% RF Tool (GUI)
%   rftool    - A graphical user interface (GUI) for creating and analyzing 
%               RF circuits.  Components and networks can be created in the   
%               GUI or imported from the MATLAB workspace or from RF data 
%               files. You can set parameters, analyze a circuit in the
%               frequency domain, and display its S-parameters in both
%               tabular and graphical form using X-Y plots, polar plots,
%               and Smith charts.
