<h3>General</h3>
<ol>
  <p> </p>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>The preview window may distort displayed images when running
MATLAB on a     computer with an 8 bit display. However, the quality of
the data logged will     not be affected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winvideo</h3>
<ol>
  <p> </p>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>There are known issues with the USB Creative WebCam drivers that
may lead     to crashes and computer reboots. It is recommended that
users only install     one of these devices per machine.</li>
  <p>TV Tuner Devices (devices with an AnalogVideoFormat video source
property)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Video input objects associated with a TV tuner card like the
ATI Rage       Theater Video Capture card, may be created with an
invalid analog format       selected. To correct this, modify the
AnalogVideoFormat property on the       currently selected video source
object. The currently selected video source       object is returned by
the GETSELECTEDSOURCE function. </li>
    <li>Some TV tuner cards may not honor the FrameGrabInterval
property value.       The ATI TV Wonder VE card is known to have this
problem. </li>
    <li>While accessing a TV tuner card, a blue screen may occur if the
preview window is repeatedly opened and closed. </li>
    <li>Some TV tuner cards may not be able to access video formats
such as YVU9       or YV12. Although IMAQHWINFO may report these formats
as supported, attempts       to acquire from them may fail. The ATI TV
Wonder VE card is known to have       this problem. </li>
    <li>Previewing is known to max out the CPU making MATLAB
unresponsive. It       is recommended that users use a low resolution in
order to reduce the CPU       load. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>DV Devices</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DV devices like camcorders are limited to the default dvsd
format provided       by the device. Additional formats will be made
available in a future toolbox       release. </li>
    <li>Previewing DV devices like camcorders, a short lag may be
visible between       the preview window display, and what is actually
captured by the device. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Matrox</h3>
<ol>
  <p> </p>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Matrox's MIL or MIL-Lite library is required and must be installed before 
    using the toolbox.</li>
  <li>The Gencout program, which is related to the Genesis board, will start when 
    you first try to use the toolbox. This causes MATLAB to lose focus. To work 
    around this behavior, uninstall the Genesis Native Library. Gencout is not 
    used by the Image Acquisition Toolbox, but it is installed by default by the 
    installation program for the Genesis drivers. </li>
  <li>It is recommended that MIL's non-paged reserved memory be greater than the 
    size of 4 incoming images. This value can be changed using Matrox's 'MIL Configuration' 
    provided with MIL. 
    <ul>
      <li>For standard RS170 and CCIR monochrome formats, at least 2MB of non-paged 
        memory is recommended.</li>
      <li>For standard NTSC and PAL color formats, at least 8MB is recommended. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Two and four band images are not supported. Dual-channel video, however, 
    is supported via a DCF file if the resulting image is a single band.</li>
  <li>UARTs are not supported. </li>
  <li>If the device supports exposure timers, they are exposed as video source 
    object properties using a 'Timer' prefix. These properties are implemented 
    using the manual bypass exposure model as described in the Matrox MIL Users 
    Guide.&nbsp; These parameters should be all set while the object is not previewing 
    or running to avoid invalid combinations of parameters while the object is 
    accessing the device.</li>
  <li>User digital inputs are not currently supported. User digital output values 
    are exposed as video source object properties using a 'UserOutputBit' prefix. 
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Acquisition devices that support image scaling might not scale images correctly 
    if the first video source is not selected. The problem is caused by the toolbox 
    only honoring the XScaleFactor and YScaleFactor property values from the first 
    video source object. If the XScaleFactor and YScaleFactor property values 
    are not equal to the currently selected video source object's values, the 
    ROIPosition and VideoResolution might reflect an incorrect value.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Translation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Device drivers should be updated to Imaging Omni CD 2.2 drivers.
These drivers     are available from the <a
 href="http://www.datatranslation.com/support/">support page</a> at <a
 href="http://www.datatranslation.com">www.datatranslation.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Data Translation drivers allow for the reservation of non-paged
'non-volatile' memory. This value should be set as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>3120, 313x, and 3152:
        <ul>
          <li>It is recommended that reserved non-paged memory be
greater than             the size of 4 incoming images. This value can
be changed in the DT             driver properties; see the DT Users
Guide for your hardware for more             information.
            <ul>
              <li>For standard RS170 and CCIR monochrome formats, at
least 2MB                 of non-paged memory is recommended</li>
              <li>For standard NTSC and PAL color formats, at least 8MB
is recommended. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>3152-LS, 3153, 3154, 3155, 3157:
        <ul>
          <li>The amount of non-paged memory must be greater than the
size of             the "total number of frames" provided by the
hardware for             a whole trigger, i.e.:
            <blockquote>
              <p>total number of frames = FramesPerTrigger *
FrameGrabInterval</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> where FramesPerTrigger and FrameGrabInterval are
properties of               the video input object.&nbsp; Refer to the
Image Acquisition Toolbox               documentation for more
information on these properties.<br>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Line scan mode for the 3152-LS is not supported. </li>
  <li>For the 3152-LS, 3153, 3154, 3155, and 3157 devices in immediate
trigger mode, the last image frame of a trigger and the first image
frame of the next     trigger may not be adjacent frames in the incoming
video, i.e., a dropped     frame(s) may occur between triggers.</li>
  <li>The 3152 may require certain color depths from your video card in
order to fully function. To determine if the proper color depth is
selected, start     DTAcquire provided with your hardware and verify
that both 'Passthru' <b>and</b> 'Single Frame Acquire' function
properly. If 'Passthru' fails, try using a     different color depth,
e.g., 24-bit truecolor instead of 32-bit truecolor.</li>
