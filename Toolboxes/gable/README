GABLE is a Matlab toolkit for geometric algebra.  
Documentation for GABLE is available at
    http://www.wins.uva.nl/~leo/clifford/gable.html
    http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~smann/gable.html

GABLE runs with Matlab 5.2, Matlab 5.3, and Matlab 6.1.

To install GABLE, untar or unzip it in a directory called
gable.  Then add the full path to this directory (including
'gable') to your Matlab path with the 'addpath' command.
