<p style="clear:left;">The unit impulse is used as an example input for the
system shown above.&nbsp; When the input to any <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">LTI
system</SPAN> is a unit impulse, the output is called the <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">impulse response</SPAN> and is denoted by
<em>h(t)</em>. So, in this example <em>h(t)</em>=<em>u(t)</em>&nbsp;  The system
in this particular example is known as an <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">integrator</SPAN> because it produces a unit step signal
as the output, according to the system's corresponding mathematical relationship
shown to the left of it.&nbsp; In general, however, any relationship which is 
<SPAN class="TextHighlight2">linear</SPAN> and <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">time-invariant</SPAN>, with unit impulse as input
qualifies as a valid impulse response for an LTI system.</p>

<TABLE cellpadding="5%">
<TR>
<TD align="left">Because such systems are <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">time-invariant</SPAN>, if the impulse is shifted to a new
location, the output is simply a shifted version of the impulse response.&nbsp;
<SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Time-invariance</SPAN> is a very helpful and
important property of continuous-time LTI systems.&nbsp; In the case of the
integrator, the output of a shifted unit impulse is a shifted unit-step function
as shown to the right.</TD>

<p style="clear:left;">The other important property of continuous LTI systems is
<SPAN class="TextHighlight2">linearity</SPAN>, which allows that the output of
an LTI system can be expressed as the sum of the outputs obtained from the
individual components that make up the input signal.&nbsp;  If both <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">linearity</SPAN> and <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">time-invariance</SPAN> hold, the output of the system can
be found through a relation known as the <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">Convolution Integral</SPAN>:</p> 

<p align="center"><IMG SRC="images/equ_2.png" WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="80"></p>

<p style="clear:left;">The above relationship means "<em>x(t)</em> convolved
with <em>h(t)</em>" where <em>h(t)</em> is the impulse response of the LTI
system.&nbsp; The variable <em>t</em> is taken to be a <strong>constant</strong>
for the integration, which is done over the <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">dummy
variable</SPAN> <em>tau</em> for all nonzero values of the input function.&nbsp;
After integration the tau variable disappears, leaving a function of time which
is in the output of the system.</p> 

<p style="clear:left;">Let us look at the argument of the impulse response
function in the integral.  Note that it is negated as a function of
<em>tau</em>, and shifted by an amount <em>t</em>.&nbsp; This effectively <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">flips</SPAN> the function over the vertical axis and
<SPAN class="TextHighlight2">shifts</SPAN> it along forward by an amount equal
to <em>t</em>.&nbsp; Depending upon the value of <em>t</em>, the <em>shifted and
flipped impulse response</em> and input function will have a particular product
and thus integrate into different piecewise functions.&nbsp; Continuous
convolutions therefore often result in functions with multiple distinct
regions.</p> 

<!-- Example using one-second pulses -->

<p style="clear:left;">Consider an example using the following system and
input:</p> 

<p align="center"><IMG SRC="images/example_system.png" WIDTH="527"
HEIGHT="156"></p> 

<p style="clear:left;">The input, shown on the left, is a pulse of length one;
the impulse response as seen on the right is a pulse of length one delayed by
one.&nbsp; Taking these two functions and converting them into the forms used in
the <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">convolution integral</SPAN> gives the
following:</p> 

<p align="center"><IMG SRC="images/example_setup.png" WIDTH="258"
HEIGHT="169"></p> 

<p style="clear:left;">As explained above, the impulse response has been flipped
over the vertical axis and is shown in red. This particular instance of
the impulse response is displayed for <em>t=0</em>; In this case, the leading edge of the pulse is
<em>t-1</em>.&nbsp; The input function <em>x(t)</em> is simply expressed in
terms of the variable <em>tau</em> instead of <em>t</em>, which is also the axis
variable of integration.</p> 

<p align="left"><IMG SRC="images/example_region_1.png" align="right"
""WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="158"><br> 
If you visualize <em>h(t)</em> <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">sliding</SPAN> along
the <em>tau</em> axis and through <em>x(t)</em>, four distinct regions of
integration become apparent.&nbsp; The first is for <em>t &#60 1</em>, which is
the same as the initial situation shown above.&nbsp; No overlap exists between
the two pulses <em>x(t)</em> and <em>h(t)</em> for this region and the integral
simply goes to zero.&nbsp; The second region is for <em>1 &#60 t &#60 2</em>,
shown to the right.&nbsp; The pulses overlap in this region in the interval from
<em><font face="symbol">t</font> = 0</em> to <em><font face="symbol">t</font> =
t-1</em>.&nbsp; The corresponding integral is evaluated below:</p><br>

<p align="left"><IMG SRC="images/equ_3.png" WIDTH="487" HEIGHT="189"></p>

<p align="left"><IMG SRC="images/example_region_2.png" align="right"
""WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="155"><br> 
A third region consists of <em>2 &#60 t &#60 3</em>,
when the leading edge of the impulse response slides passed the leading edge of
the input signal.&nbsp; This is shown in the plot to the right.&nbsp; In this
region the pulses overlap from <em><font face="symbol">t</font> = t-2</em> to
<em><font face="symbol">t</font> = 1</em>.&nbsp; The integral for this region is
evaluated as shown below:</p><br>

<p align="left"><IMG SRC="images/equ_4.png" WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="170"></p>
      
<p style="clear:left;"></p>

<p align="center">
<TABLE cellpadding="20%">
<TR>
<TD align="left">After <em>t=3</em>, no overlap occurs and the integral goes to
zero.&nbsp; Note that at <em>t = 2</em> between the second and third regions,
both pulses completely overlap and the integral evaluates to the greatest value
of the output signal.&nbsp; Combining the above results, our output signal is a
piecewise linear function defined and plotted to the right.</TD>

</TABLE>

<p style="clear:left;">You may simulate this on the convolution GUI by setting
the input as an impulse of length one, and the impulse response the same but
shifted by one.&nbsp; Observe carefully the contents of the <SPAN
class="TextHighlight">Multiplication</SPAN> window as you slide the impulse
response function along in the top window; note how the area shown relates to
the integrated value in the <SPAN  
class="TextHighlight">Convolution</SPAN> window.</p>

<p style="clear:left;">Another important property of convolution is <SPAN
class="TextHighlight2">Commutativity</SPAN>, which stipulates that the order of
convolution does not matter.&nbsp; Flipping and shifting the input signal
<em>x(t)</em> instead of the impulse response <em>h(t)</em>, therefore, will
have the same result as the procedures above.&nbsp; The following proof
establishes that convolution is indeed commutative:</p> 

<p align="center"><IMG SRC="images/equ_6.png" WIDTH="502" HEIGHT="158"></p>

<p style="clear:left;">The new dummy variable <em>sigma</em> is insignificant in
the evaluation of the integral; all operations are done exactly as shown in the
convolution example above, substituting <em>x(t)</em> for <em>h(t).</em></p> 

<p>Does it all make sense to you?&nbsp; If you are not sure go over it again,
and make sure to attempt several examples with the different functions offered
in the GUI so you can verify them.</p>
