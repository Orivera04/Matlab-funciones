On startup, the main window shows the default view of the volume; one can always return to this view by selecting 
"Views" | "Default view"

This view, like any other, can be changed by selecting an option in the drop-down menu "Views". The options are fairly self-explanatory.

"Views" | "Clear figure"    removes the volume (or slices etc.) but keeps the axes (as mentioned above, the default volume can be re-displayed via "Views" | "Default view").

"Views" | "Grid"    toggles the grid on and off.

"Views" | "Color selection"    brings up a GUI for the section of color schemes and displays some statistics that may help in the selection of the color range.
