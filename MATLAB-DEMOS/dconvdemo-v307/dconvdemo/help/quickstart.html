<p>Hopefully, a person could start using the MATLAB convolution tool without any need to
read these help files.&nbsp; Features were designed to be intuitive and familiar to those
with basic computer experience. <small><em>If not send me mail by clicking on my name in the Overview section!!</em></small></p>

<p>For those who like to read the manual (don't be ashamed, I am one of these people),
this section will give you the minimum you need to get started and be comfortable with the
use of the GUI.</p>

<p>First, if you have not already done so, follow the information given in the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Installation</SPAN> section to install and start the MATLAB convolution tool.</p>

<p>To begin, pick an input signal and an impulse response: 

<ol>
  <li>Press the <strong>Get x[n]</strong> button in the main window.&nbsp; A second window
    should open with a pulse signal displayed.&nbsp; If you wish, alter the signal type using
    the list box at the top of the window, and alter the signal parameters with the controls along
    the right side.&nbsp; When satisfied click the <strong>OK</strong> button.&nbsp; The
    signal you picked is now displayed within the <strong>Input</strong> plot box.<br>
    <br>
    <em><small>Note:&nbsp; The signal may not be fully displayed when changing the signal
    parameters.&nbsp; To replot the signal, click inside the plot box.</small><br>
    <br>
    </em></li>
  <li>Make sure the <strong>Flip h[n]</strong> radio button is checked and then pick an
    impulse response by pressing the <strong>Get h[n]</strong> button.&nbsp; After choosing
    an impulse response and closing the window, the three large axes will now contain the
    following information:<br>
    <br>
    - The top axis displays the <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Input</SPAN> signal
    in blue and flipped version of the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Impulse Response</SPAN>
    in red.<br>
    <br>
    - The middle axis shows the result of the point-by-point multiplication of the two
    signals displayed in the top plot box. (This may initially be empty.)<br>
    <br>
    - The bottom axis shows the output of the linear convolution between the <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Input</SPAN>
    signal and the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Impulse Response</SPAN> signal.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There are two labels with arrows pointing to the current location of the <strong>n</strong>
    index.&nbsp; One is below the <strong>Signal / Flipped Signal</strong> plot box.&nbsp; The
    other is above the <strong>Output</strong> plot box.&nbsp; Move the mouse over either of
    these.&nbsp; The mouse pointer should become a hand symbol indicating that the current <strong>n</strong>
    index can be changed by dragging the <strong>n</strong> index label.<br>
    <br>
    Go ahead and
    drag the <strong>n</strong> index label around to change the value of the current index
    location.&nbsp; Quite a few things happen: The <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Flipped Impulse Response</SPAN> follows the location of the <strong>n</strong> index location, and the <strong>multiplication</strong>
    plot changes depending on the relative overlap between the <SPAN class="TextHighlight2">Input</SPAN> signal and the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Flipped Impulse
    Response</SPAN>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Change the <strong>n</strong> index so that the two signals overlap in the <strong>Signal
    / Flipped Signal</strong> window.  There will now be a nonzero plot within the <strong>multiplication</strong>
    axis.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the sample at the current <strong>n</strong> index is highlighted in the <strong>Output</strong>
    plot.&nbsp; The numeric value (i.e., the value on the y axis) of this sample is determined
    by adding together all the values of the samples within the <strong>multiplication</strong>
    plot.<br>
    <br>
    Ex.&nbsp; If the signals overlapped so that the <strong>multiplication</strong> plot
    showed three samples each with a value of 2, the highlighted value in the <strong>output</strong>
    plot would have a value of 6.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it!&nbsp; You now understand the basics of how to use the MATLAB convolution
tool.&nbsp; For a more in depth description of convolution theory and how a convolution is
calculated see the <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Theory</SPAN> section.&nbsp; The <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Controls</SPAN> and <SPAN class="TextHighlight">Menus</SPAN>
sections provide a description of all the elements in the user interface.</p>
