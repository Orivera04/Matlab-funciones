{\bfIs this machine connected to the target via a BDM cable?} 

You must use the BDM connection if you are installing bootcode for the first time.

{\bfBDM Download Process}

In this case your debugger will be launched and a download kernel will be loaded on to the target.   Then, the Download Control Panel will be launched allowing you to download the bootcode via either a CAN or Serial connection to the target.

{\bfDownload Process without BDM}

In this case an existing bootcode must already be installed on your target.   The Download Control Panel will be launched allowing you to upgrade the bootcode via a CAN or Serial connection to the target.

Note 1: If you have an R12.1 or R13 bootcode installed on your target you will either need to connect via a BDM connection or see the documentation for an alternative CAN bootcode upgrade mechanism.   Choose {\it\bfCancel} or connect via BDM and choose {\it\bfYes}

Note 2: If you have an R13SP1 bootcode installed, and you choose not to connect via a BDM connection, you will only be able to upgrade the bootcode via a CAN connection.   The R13SP1 bootcode does not support a Serial connection.

Note 3: If the download process fails then the bootcode may become corrupt.   In this case a BDM Bootcode Download will be necessary.
