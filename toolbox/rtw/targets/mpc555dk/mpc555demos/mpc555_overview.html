<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Embedded Target 
for Motorola&#x00AE; MPC555 Demonstrations</p>

<p>The Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555 enables you to run Real-Time 
Workshop Embedded Coder generated code on an MPC555 microcontroller.</p>

<p>Core capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time execution including MPC555 I/O drivers
<li>Processor-in-the-Loop cosimulation
<li>Report generation with RAM/ROM measurements
<li>Automatic build, download and run on target hardware
</ul>

<p>The Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555 supports rapid prototyping and deployment 
of your application, as well as code validation and performance analysis.</p>
<p>See the demos for examples of automatic code generation and download to the target, real-time I/O and CAN messaging, processor-in-the-loop cosimulation, multitasking and execution profiling.</p>

<h3>Block Libraries</h3>
<p>The Embedded Target for Motorola MPC555 includes several driver libraries that let you add I/O driver blocks to your controller for interfacing to hardware. The top level library contains sublibraries and two blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li> The MPC555 Resource Configuration block. This supports driver configuration for MPC555 and MIOS, QADC, TPU and TouCAN submodules.
<li>The Watchdog timer block. In the event of application failure, this times out and resets the processor.
<li>All other driver blocks are contained in the following sublibraries: CAN, Execution Profiling, Interrupts, MIOS, QADC, Serial and TPU.

<ul>
<li>CAN 2.0B Controller Module (TouCAN) Sublibrary
<p>You can add CAN Message Blocks to your controller, enabling you to send CAN messages containing signal data from your controller subsystem using either standard or extended CAN identifiers.</p>
<li>Execution Profiling Sublibrary
<p>Execution Profiling blocks provide an interface to the execution profiling engine over serial or CAN. On receipt of a start command message, logging of execution profile data is commenced. On completion of a logging run, the recorded data is automatically returned via serial or CAN.</p>
<li>Interrupts Sublibrary
<p>For reading or writing signals attached to Asynchronous subsystems, driven by interrupt function call triggers.</p>
<li>Modular Input/Output System (MIOS1) Sublibrary
<p>You can add MIOS Blocks to your controller, enabling you to use digital I/O via the MIOS 16-bit parallel port I/O submodule, the MIOS Pulse Width Modulation Submodule, and support pulse width and pulse period measurement via the MIOS Double Action Submodule.</p>
<li>Queued Analog-to-Digital Converter (QADC) Module-64 Sublibrary
<p>You can add QADC Blocks to your controller. The QADC Digital In block enables you to use Queued Analog-Digital Converter (QADC64) pins as digital inputs, and the QADC Analog In block enables you to use the QADC64 in continuous scan mode.</p>
<li>Time Processor Unit (TPU3) Sublibrary
<p>You can add TPU driver blocks to your controller, enabling you to use the TPU modules for digital I/O, fast quadrature decode, pulse width modulation, new input capture/input transition counting, and the programmable time accumulator.</p>
<li>Serial Communications Interface (SCI) Sublibrary
<p>You can add Serial Transmit and Receive Blocks to your controller, to configure the MPC555 for serial communications on either of the QSMCM submodules SCI1 or SCI2.</p>
