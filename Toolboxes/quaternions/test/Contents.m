% Unit Tests for the Quaternion Toolbox
%
% NOTE: You need the test_tools toolbox to run these tests.  It should be
% available from the same place this toolbox was obtained.
%
%   This script runs all the unit tests and records the output in test.out:
%
%     unit_test
%
%   The individual unit tests are just the function name preceeded by
%   "test_"
