<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Tutorial#1</b></font><br>

<p>This tutorial is a step-by-step instruction to create an animation with the Marine Visualization Toolbox.
Before starting make sure the MVT toolbox is correctly installed: While in your <EM>work</EM> folder, type
<EM>help mvt</EM>. This should display the contents of the MVT, if not see the <A HREF="install_tbx.html">
installation instructions</A>.

<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 1 - Setting up the 6 DOF data</b></font>

<p>It is assumed that yuo are already familiar with 6 DOF data, if not see
<A HREF="basic.html#dof">6 DOF data</A> in <A HREF="basic.html">Marine Visualization basics</A>.
Operating on structures and arrays are described <A HREF="basic.html#struct_arr">here</A>.
<p>In MVT the 6 DOF data is represented by a two dimensional matrix, with N row and 6 columns (Nx6),
where N is the total number of data samples.
Each row holds the values of the 6 vessel states in the following order: [x y z phi theta psi] (Equal to:
[x y z roll pitch yaw]). All angles are given in radians.
<p><B>Step 1:</B>
<p>Load the saved data from <EM>tut1-01.mat</EM> (Hint: Highlight the text below, right click and select
<EM>Evaluate Selection</EM>):
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filename = fullfile(matlabroot, 'toolbox', 'mvt', 'tutorials', 'tut1-01.mat');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;load(filename);
</span>
<p>This command loads the 6 DOF data saved in tut1-01.mat into your MATLAB workspace as a variable
named sixDOF. To see the contents of the array, type:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sixDOF
</span>
<p>To plot the 6 DOF data, for instance the <I>xy</I>-positions, type something like:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plot(sixDOF(:,1), sixDOF(:,2), 'r-')
</span>
<p>This will plot a red line in the <I>xy</I>-plane, recall that <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>
is found in the first and second column.


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 2 - Setting up the time vector</b></font>

<p>Since animations describe movement over time, the relative time of each sample
(each row in the 6 DOF data) must be identified. This is done in a column vector,
with dimensions Nx1. Each entry, n = 1...N, contain the time value for it's respective
samples (rows in sixDOF). The time vector may have varying time steps (the time between
subsequent time values), but must be strictly increasing.
<p><B>Step 2:</B>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filename = fullfile(matlabroot, 'toolbox', 'mvt', 'tutorials', 'tut1-02.mat');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;load(filename);
</span>
<p>This loads the time vector <I>time_vec</I> to your MATLAB workspace, to see it's contents, type:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time_vec
</span>
<p>The column vector <I>time_vec</I> now contains the time values (in seconds) for the samples in sixDOF.
Note that the length of <I>time_vec</I> equals the length of <I>sixDOF</I>.
<p>To see how any of the variables in the 6 DOF data vary over time, for instance the <I>x</I>-position
(<I>yaw</I> or <I>psi</I>), type:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plot(time_vec, sixDOF(:,1), 'r-');
</span>
<p>This will plot the <I>x</I>-position versus time. This line is drawn from one sample point to another,
if you want to see the sample points, type:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold on;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plot(time_vec, sixDOF(:,1), 'bo');
</span>
<p>These commands first tell MATLAB not to erase the old plot, then to plot the sample points as blue circles.


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 3 - Setting up the vessel structure</b></font>

<p>Most function arguments in MVT are based on <A HREF="basic.html#struct_arr">structures</A>,
a structure can hold several values of different classes (e.g. double and char). Structures
are created using the .-operator (the <I>dot</I>-operator), structure arrays are created
simply by indexing the structure name, see example below. Variables contained in a structure
is called a <I>field</I>, see <I>struct</I> for more information on structures.
<p>Structures may be named anything for use with MVT, but the <I>fields</I> must apply to the
following convention:
<ul>
	<li>The 6 DOF data must be in a field named <I><B>x</B></I>.</li>
	<li>The time vector must be in a field named <I><B>t</B></I>.</li>
</ul>
<p><B>Step 3:</B>
<p>The 6 DOF data and time vector representing one particular vessel must be organized in a structure.
In this example we name this structure <I>vesselData</I>. To insert the 6 DOF data <I>sixDOF</I> and
the time vector <I>time_vec</I> into vesselData, type:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vesselData.x = sixDOF;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vesselData.t = time_vec;
</span>
<p>To view the contents of <I>vesselData</I>, type:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vesselData
</span>
<p>This command will describe the contents of <I>vesselData</I>.
<br>To retrieve, or edit, a specific field
in the structure, use the dot-operator, for instance:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vesselData.x<br>
</span>
<p>These commands will print the contents of <I>vesselData.x</I>.


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 4 - Starting <I>mvtguide</I></b></font>

<p>The function <I>mvtguide</I> calls other functions of MVT in the following order:
<ul>
	<li>verifydata - Verify input user data</li>
	<li>typedef - Link the verified user data to vessel 3D models</li>
	<li>createvrml - Assemble the linked 3D models into a single file</li>
	<li>director - Graphical user interface where animations finally are created</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are an experienced MATLAB user these functions may be called manually
(see their help pages for input-output arguments), as <I>mvtguide</I> is only
a help function to keep track of input and output arguments.
<p><B>Step 4:</B>
<p>Call <I>mvtguide</I> with the newly created structure as input argument:
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mvtguide(vesselData)<br>
</span>
<p>This command calls the <I>mvtguide</I> function, which in turn prompts the user
for input of varios kinds, see following steps.


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 5 - Define type of vessel</b></font>

<p>By executing the steps above you should now see a dialog box named <I>Settings</I>, this
is where you define the type of vessels in youre animation, and what scene the vessels will
be animated in. In this tutorial you should select the <I>Cybership</I> vessel model and <I>basin</I>
scene model, but any selections are valid (the input 6 DOF data will probably not match any other
vessel model).
<p><B>Step 5:</B>
<p>Select the vessel model named <I>Cybership</I> in the list: <I>Selected vessel is linked to...</I>
<p>Select the scene model named <I>basin</I> in the popupmenu: <I>Select scene:</I>
<p>Confirm your choiches by pressing the <EM>OK</EM> button. The vessel is now linked to a 3D model, and
a 3D scene is selected as the surroundings for the animation. These are passed to the <I>createvrml</I>
function.


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 6 - Saving the VRML file</b></font>

<p>You are now prompted for a filename by <I>createvrml</I>, the requested filename is where
the vessel model and scene model are assembled into one single file. You should specify a
filename that make it easy to identify later, in this tutorial you should name it <I>my_tutorial.wrl</I>,
otherwise the tutorial might not complete.
<p><B>Step 6:</B>
<p>Enter the filename <B><EM>my_tutorial.wrl</EM></B> and press <I>OK</I>.


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 7 - Setting up a sequence</b></font>

<p>Two new windows should now appear on your screen, and look like the two figures below. If not,
check the error message in your MATLAB workspace. See help on <A HREF="director.html">director</A>
for detailed information on fields and settings.<br>
<p><IMG SRC="vrw_01.jpg" BORDER=0><br>
Figure of the virtual reality figure window.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><IMG SRC="vrw_02.jpg" BORDER=0><br>
Figure of the <I>director</I> graphical user interface
<p>The huge donut diplayed in the virtual world is the path of the vessel, to decrease it's size
enter a smaller value in the <I>Path Size</I> field. The pool is the selected scene model <I>basin</I>.
<p><B>Step 7:</B>
<p>To decrease the size of the vessel path, enter a smaller value in the <I>Path Size</I> field, for
instance 0.01. You should now be able to see the vessel <I>Cybership</I>, which is positioned according
to the first sample in the 6 DOF data.
<p> Select the desired viewpoint from the viewpiont list, viewpoints with prefix <I>vessel</I> move with
the specified vessel, while all other viewpionts stay fixed to the scene model.
<p>The selected viewpoint, start sample, end sample, Vessel settings and World settings define a sequence,
press the <I>Add sequence</I> button to add the sequence to the total animation. All sequences are listed
in the animation listbox, which now should look something like the above figure.
<p>Press <I>Play sequence</I> to preview the sequence.
<p>Press <I>Record</I> to save the animation to file, you are prompted for video settings. The default
values should produce a satisfactory result in most cases, but remeber to change the filename to avoid
overwriting old video-files. Select or enter the filename <I>my_tutorial.avi</I>. Recording will
start, and a bar shows the recording progress. Make sure that the figure window is not minimized or
completely covered by other windows while recording, this will ruin the video-file!


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=+2 color="#990000"><b>Step 8 - View the saved animation</b></font>

<p>When recording is finished, locate your newly created video-file (which was specified just before
the recording started) in the file browser, and play the animation!


<p>&nbsp;
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
<p>To get to know the functionality of <I>director</I>, experiment by changing the settings,
change the viewpoint, record different sample intervals, change the appearance of your vessel, record
several sequences into one animation etc.
