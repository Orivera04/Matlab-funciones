function demoThreeRes(z,maxit)
% demoThreeRes  Solve the three reservoir problem with Newton's method
%
% Synopsis:  demoThreeRes(z,maxit)
%
% Input:  z = (optional) vector of four elements containing the elevation
%              of each of the three reservoirs (z(1:3)) and the elevation
%              of the junction, z(4).  Default:  z = [30; 18; 9; 11] (m).
%         maxit = (optional) max number of iterations.  Default: maxit = 5
%
% Output:  Solution is printed to command window
