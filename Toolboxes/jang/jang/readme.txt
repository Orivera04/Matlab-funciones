================= SOFT COMPUTING TOOLBOX =================

This is a package of MATLAB programs that complement the text:

	"Neuro-Fuzzy and Soft Computing,"
	by Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, Chuen-Tsai Sun, and Eiji Mizutani
	Prentice Hall, 1997
	http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~jang/soft.htm

Some of these files require the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox by The MathWorks; these
files are labeled with * in Appendix C of the text.

The email address to request this toolbox is "info@mathworks.com".
The toolbox is available via ftp at:

	ftp://ftp.mathworks.com/pub/books/jang/*

(You need to set binary transfer mode for some of the data files.)

The most recent version of the toolbox is available from the textbook's
homepage at

	http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~jang/soft.htm

(It's possible to get the whole directory as a .gz, .zip or .exe file from the
above homepage.)

This toolbox is written to be used with MATLAB 4.2c.
Suggestions for the toolbox can be directed to:

	J.-S. Roger Jang: jang@cs.nthu.edu.tw
	Eiji Mizutani:    eiji@biosys2.me.berkeley.edu

To use the toolbox more easily, you should copy all the files to your hard disk.
To do so, type the following commands under DOS prompt:

	mkdir c:\soft
	copy a:\soft\*.* c:\soft

If you want to use the toolbox from anywhere, you should add c:\soft to MATLAB's
search path. To do so, type the following commands under MATLAB prompt:

	path('c:\soft', path);

Now you can execute any command of the toolbox from anywhere.

For MATLAB itself, all questions should be directed to "support@mathworks.com".
For the Student Version, Prentice-Hall gives support via "matlab@prenhall.com".

These M-files are User Contributed Routines which are being redistributed by
The MathWorks, upon request, on an "as is" basis.  A User Contributed Routine
