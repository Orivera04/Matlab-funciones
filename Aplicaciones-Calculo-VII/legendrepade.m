% Legendre-Pade Algorithm
%
% This script takes the function f(x) sampled at the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto 
% nodes and computes the legendre coefficients for the functions a(x) and b(x)
% such that a(x)~=b(x)f(x)
%
% Note: the number of nodes (length of f) must be odd.
%
% Parameters: f    - function sampled at LGL nodes
%             ahat - expansion coeffs of numerator
%             bhat - expansion coeffs of denominator
