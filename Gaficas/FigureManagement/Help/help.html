  <h1> Figure Management </h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These M-files are a collection of utilities for
managing groups of figures. The concept of a figure group is
introduced as a collection of figures which may be treated
as a single group. A figure group can be tiled on the screen with any 
desired layout. New groups can be created or a group or can be formed from 
figures already created. A figure group can also be simply brought to the front 
of the display screen. Figure groups will work with multiple monitor displays, 
also known<img border="2" src="Figure%20Tiling.gif" width="512" height="384" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="8"> as the extended desktop, though figure groups do not span more than 
one monitor. Figure groups are defined and accessed by a variable which is an 
array of the figure handles in the group. Thus for example to close the entire 
figure group, use <i>close(a)</i> where <i>a</i> is the array of figure handles 
(i.e. [1,3,4,6,7,9]).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actions such as tiling, creating, and viewing 
can create figure groups. At right is an example of 6 figures tiled on the 
screen with room for the taskbar. The figures have their own numbering scheme 
designated by <i>#N</i>. Thus if the figure group is referenced by the variable
<i>a</i>, then <i>a(2)</i> refers to the second figure in the group irregardless 
of the figure's handle number.</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">Support is also provided for working with 
	docked figures in the Matlab desktop using DOCKFIG and NEWDFIG. The utility MAXFIG will maximize a 
	figure to fill the screen, remembering it's prior position and size. A 
	subsequent call to MAXFIG will restore the figure. Two versions are provided 
	for MAXFIG, NEWFIG, and TILEFIG in the folders &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;Platform 
	Independent&quot; to provide support for multiple monitors. The &quot;Windows&quot; 
	versions use the root property &quot;MonitorPositions&quot; and thus may not work 
	properly on all platforms and will not work for Matlab versions prior to 
	version 7 (R14). The &quot;Platform Independent&quot; versions should work on earlier 
	releases and all platforms.</p>
