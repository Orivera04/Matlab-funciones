Matlab Version 5 Toolbox for 
Ordinal Data Modeling by Valen Johnson and James Albert
Springer-Verlag, New York, 1999.

This toolbox contains programs for performing all of the model fitting and
 model diagnostic algorithms and plots that are described in the text.  All of 
the datasets discussed in the text and exercises are available, and there are 
example m-files which illustrate the use of the programs in analyzing the 
datasets that are discussed in the text.

The programs were created using release 5 of Matlab.  Each Matlab function 
is self-contained and the Statistics Toolbox and other utility 
functions are not required.

The programs are organized by the chapter where the routines are used.  
In addition to the main progams, the toolbox contains a collection of 
"teaching Bayes" functions which are useful for performing calculations 
for the introductory chapters 1 and 2.

Please direct any questions on the use of these programs to:
