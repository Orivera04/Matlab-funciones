This document itemizes the sections that you may install to 
access the MCSTD or AMCSTD toolbox.  The files necessary are:

1) Toolbox.exe
2) Demo.exe
3) Figures.exe
4) Problems.exe
5) Synopsis.doc
6) Tutorial.exe
7) Install.doc

The above files that end in ".exe" are self-extracting Zip files.
They can be expanded by creating a directory on your computer for the
files and executing the file (in DOS or Windows), which will expand out
its contents into your current directory.
For simplicity, the expanded version is also available on the MATLAB ftp site.

The Synopsis file contains a synopsis of the book.

The tutorial file contains a tutorial with sample installation documentation.
The tutorial file also explains the increased functionality that the MCSTD 
or AMCSTD gives the MATLAB user.

Please read the Synopsis and Tutorial to get further information.
