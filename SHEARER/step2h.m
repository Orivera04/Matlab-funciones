% 	STEP2 -- Step Response of second order linear systems
%
%
%This file plots the response to a unit step input of a linear
%second order system.
%
%The user can change the natural frequency of the system
%(in rad/s) and the critical damping ratio by manipulating
%the sliders.
%
%The response is shown in violet, the input in yellow.
%
%By pressing the 'Show Lines' button, the user can see
%some of the details of the step response.
%
%A horizontal red line shows the maximum overshoot of
%the response while a vertical green line indicates
%the settling time as determined by 4 times the real part
%of the system roots.
