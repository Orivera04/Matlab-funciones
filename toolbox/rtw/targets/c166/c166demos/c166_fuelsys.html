<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Fixed-point fuel control system</p>

<p>This demo model was derived from the demo fuelsys.mdl. The floating point control algorithm has been converted to fixed point in order to allow efficient code generation for the C166® microcontroller. Note that this demo model requires licenses for Fixed-Point Blockset, Stateflow and Stateflow Coder.</p>

<ol>
<li>To open this model, click the link or at the command line type
<a href="matlab:c166_fuelsys">c166_fuelsys
</a>
<li>To generate code and download to the target, right click on the <code>controller</code> subsytem and select <strong>Tools -&gt; Real-Time Workshop -&gt;Build Subsystem</strong>. Click <strong>Build</strong> in the following dialog to continue the code generation process.
</ol>

<p>See the Simple Example Applications Tutorial in the User's Guide for details on which settings in this demo reduce RAM and ROM requirements compared to the original model.</p>
