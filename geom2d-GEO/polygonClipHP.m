function poly2 = polygonClipHP(poly, line)
%POLYGONCLIPHP clip a polygon with Half-plane defined with directed line
%
%   usage :
%   POLY2 = polygonClipHP(POLY, LINE)
%   POLY is a [Nx2] array of points, and LINE is given as [x0 y0 dx dy].
%   The result POLY2 is also an array of points, sometimes smaller than
%   poly, and that can be [0x2] (empty polygon).
