%   LIN1 -- Experiments with function linearization
%
%This demonstration utilizes MATLAB's GUI to allow the student
%to experiment with the concept of linearization.
%
%The function plotted is a cubic function (x^3+x).  Use the
%slides to select the normal operating point about which the
%linearization is to be performed.  The tangent line (in green)
%is immediately drawn at that point.
%
%The second slide selects an error tolerance  over which
%the linearization is to be valid.  The red vertical lines represent
%the range of the function over which the linearization error (percent 
%difference between the nonlinear and linear function) falls within
%the prescribed tolerance.  As the tolerance increses, the lines move
%futher apart.
