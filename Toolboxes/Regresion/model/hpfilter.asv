%   Hodrick-Prescott filter extracts the trend of a time series, the output
%   is not a formula but a new filtered time series.  This trend can be
%   adjusted with parameter w; values for w lie usually in the interval
%   [100,20000], and it is up to you to use the one you like, As w approaches infty, 
%   H-P will approach a line.  If the series doesn't have a trend p.e.White Noise, 
%   doing H-P is meaningles
%
%   [s] = hpfilter(y,w)
%   w = Smoothing parameter (Economists advice: "Use w = 1600 for quarterly data")
%   y = Original series
%   s = Filtered series
%   This program can work with several series at a time, as long as the
%   number of series you are working with doesn't exceed the number of
%   elements in the series + it uses sparse matrices which improves speed
%   and performance in the longest series
%   
%   [s] = hpfilter(y,w,'makeplot')
%   'makeplot' in the input, plots the graphics of the original series
%   against the filtered series, if more than one series is being
%   considered the program will plot all of them in different axes
%
%   [s,desvabs] = hpfilter(y,w)
%   Gives you a mesure of the standardized differences in absolute values
%   between the original and the filtered series.  A big desvabs means
%   that the series implies a large relative volatility.
