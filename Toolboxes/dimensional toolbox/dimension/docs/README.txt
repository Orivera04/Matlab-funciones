Extract dimension.zip to your $MATLABROOT\toolbox
directory. A subdirectory dimension is created.
In $MATLABROOT\toolbox\dimension start the script
file dinst.m with Matlab. To make the changes to
the Matlab search path permanent you must then
use the File -> Set Path utility in Matlab to
save the search path settings or edit the file
$MATLABROOT\toolbox\local\pathdef.m manually.

Requirements:

the matrix editor matedit cannot be used.

The DA Toolbox was developed and tested under
- MS Windows 2000
- Matlab 6.1 (R12.1)
