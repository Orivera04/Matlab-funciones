MATLAB Movie to MPEG Converter
------------------------------

MPEG is an ISO standard movie encoding format.  The MPEG converter
for MATLAB takes a MATLAB movie matrix and writes the movie to disk
as an MPEG file with file extension ".mpg".

The MPEG converter is a MATLAB mex file which can be built using the
included Makefile by calling make at the unix prompt.  An ANSI C
compiler is required.  Makefile can be modified if necessary to specify
an ANSI compiler.  The resulting mex file can be invoked by calling 
"mpgwrite" from the MATLAB command line.
On the PC, run the makedll m-file from within MATLAB.
Both Makefile and makedll.m can be found in the src subdirectory along
with the source code.

For documentation on the use of mpgwrite, read the file "mpgwrite.doc".

Portions of the MPEG converter are Copyrighted (c) 1993 by The
Regents of the University of California.

The MATLAB 5 revision of mpgwrite.c was uploaded by Stephen Bond 
(bond@math.ukans.edu) and has been incorporated into the MATLAB 5 
mpgwrite sources along with other minor modifications for the PC to
support compilers other than WATCOM.

An MPEG to MATLAB movie converter is also available.
