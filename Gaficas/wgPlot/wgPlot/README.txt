Title: wgPlot - Weighted Graph Plot (a better version of gplot)

Summary: Plot graphs with weighted vertices and weighted edges.

Description:
Plot graphs just like gplot. But allow user to input an adjacency matrix with weighted edges and/or weighted vertices. The Edge weights are mapped to a colormap. The vertex weights are proprotional to the vertex size. Using parameter-value pairs, user can even specify the vertex scaling factor, edge width, and the colormap used to show other meta data associated with the vertices.
