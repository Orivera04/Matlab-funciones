      <h2>structures<a name="1"></a></h2>
      <p>Structures are a useful way of grouping MATLAB variables that 
belong together.  For example, imagine that you're simulating
         a ball being dropped from a building. You might have a scalar 
representing the mass of the ball, a vector representing its
         position, another vector representing its velocity, etc.  You 
can group all the ball properties together into a MATLAB <b>structure</b> called <tt>ball</tt>:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">clear
ball.mass = 10;
ball.position = [0, 0, 100];
ball.velocity = [0, 0, 0];
</pre><h2>examining structures<a name="2"></a></h2>
      <p>To see the contents of a structure, just type it's name at the command prompt &gt;&gt;</p><pre class="codeinput">ball
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ball = 

        mass: 10
    position: [0 0 100]
    velocity: [0 0 0]

</pre><p>The individual components of the structure are called <b>fields</b>. You can also examine the content of an individual field:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">ball.position
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =

     0     0   100

</pre><h2>adding fields<a name="4"></a></h2>
      <p>You can operate on elements of the structure just like any other MATLAB variable. For example to move the current XYZ-position
         of the ball by +10 in the y direction, you could type:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">ball.position = ball.position + [0, 10, 0]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ball = 

        mass: 10
    position: [0 10 100]
    velocity: [0 0 0]

</pre><p>You can add a new <b>field</b> to the data structure at any time. For example, we'll add a new field for the radius and set its value:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">ball.radius = 2.0
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ball = 

        mass: 10
    position: [0 10 100]
    velocity: [0 0 0]
      radius: 2

</pre><h2>arrays of structures<a name="6"></a></h2>
      <p>You can have an array of structures to represent multiple objects. For example, let's create two more "balls" by making a
         copy of the original "ball" structure:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">ball(2:3,1) = ball;
</pre><p>now let's see what has happened:</p><pre class="codeinput">ball
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ball = 

3x1 struct array with fields:
    mass
    position
    velocity
    radius

</pre><p>MATLAB tells us that "ball" is now a 3x1 struct array. Each of the three elements of the struct array is a "ball" structure.
         Let's say we wanted each of the three balls to have a different mass:
      </p><pre class="codeinput">ball(1).mass = 1.0;
ball(2).mass = 5.0;
ball(3).mass = 10.0;
</pre><p>Let's look at ball(2) now:</p><pre class="codeinput">ball(2)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans = 

        mass: 5
    position: [0 10 100]
    velocity: [0 0 0]
      radius: 2

</pre><h2>accessing struct array contents<a name="10"></a></h2>
      <p>Now let's examine the masses of all three balls:</p><pre class="codeinput">ball.mass
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =

     1


ans =

     5


ans =

    10

</pre><p>Notice that MATLAB returned 3 different answers, one for each structure in the struct array.</p>
      <p>Usually, we'd like all of these answers returned together in a single array. This can be accomplished by enclosing everything
         in square brackets.
      </p><pre class="codeinput">[ball.mass]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =

     1     5    10

</pre><p>So, if we wanted to compute the total mass of all three balls, we could type:</p><pre class="codeinput">totalMass = sum([ball.mass])
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">totalMass =

    16

</pre><p>However, if we tried it without the square brackets, we would get an obscure error message:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="keyword">try</span>
    totalMass = sum(ball.mass)
<span class="keyword">catch</span>
    lasterr
<span class="keyword">end</span>
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =

Error using ==&gt; sum
Trailing string input must be 'double' or 'native'.

</pre><p>If you see strange error messages like the one above when using struct arrays, it should make you think about square brackets!</p>

%% structures
% Structures are a useful way of grouping MATLAB variables
% that belong together.  For example, imagine that you're simulating

% scalar representing the mass of the ball, a vector
% representing its position, another vector representing

% together into a MATLAB *structure* called |ball|:
clear
ball.mass = 10;
ball.position = [0, 0, 100];
ball.velocity = [0, 0, 0];

%% examining structures

%%
% The individual components of the structure are called *fields*.
% You can also examine the content of an individual field:
ball.position

%% adding fields
% You can operate on elements of the structure just like any other
% MATLAB variable. For example to move the current XYZ-position
% of the ball by +10 in the y direction, you could type:

ball.position = ball.position + [0, 10, 0]

% You can add a new *field* to the data structure at any time.
