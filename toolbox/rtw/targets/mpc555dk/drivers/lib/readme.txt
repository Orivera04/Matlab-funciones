# This file is place-holder for the
#      <matlabroot>\toolbox\rtw\targets\mpc555dk\drivers\lib
# directory. This directory contains static object librarys required 
# for target generation.
# 
# There is a naming convention for libraries. First of all the library
# is placed in the directory of whose toolchain built that library. Secondly
# the library name indicates what processor variant it has been built for.

# name              -   Anything you wish
# mpc5xx_variant    -   5xx     -   This library will be used for all variants
#                       555     -   This library will be used only for 555 variants
