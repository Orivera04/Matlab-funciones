Simulink models evolving systems!

function output = name(input1,input2)
matlab can't store or deal with a number with more than 15 decimal
  or that consists of more places than can be stored in a base 2 number
  with the number of digits equal to the size of the processor's memory.
  (each place is a transistor)
variables inside a functionneed to be declared global to be accessible
  by other m-files. I didn't use this since by variable declarations
  are not in the function code of the GUI but in the callbacks which
  seem to set variables in the Matlab workspace.
infinite loops freeze matlab
N-D arrays.  use CAT function
matrix definition     A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
() for functions
% starts a comment line
{} unsure of use, type help paren in matlab for text
shift + enter gives another line
  use "..." at end of line when dealing with text
right click has evaluate for functions, open for things to be opened,
  or help on the selection like a function name
can make a hyperlink which executes something when clicked
commands are buffered while the computer is busy
seperate multiple functions with a comma, or semi-colon(to supress output)
up arrow brings up last entry
  type a few letters then push up arrow, brings up last entry that started
  with those letters
Tab key after typing a few letters, matlab will complete name for you
clc clears command window
more command brings up one page of data ata a time
  enter will advance one line, space bar one page, q will stop readout
format command changes output display of data
diary command records what you do excluding graphics
to display each function as it executes when running an m-file, put echo on under display preferences
ctrl-C to stop matlab
! means the rest of the line is sent to the operating system, to for instance run an outside program
open or edit then name brings the m-file up in the editor
  type displays the contents of an m-file in command windows
when an error occurs from running an m-file, put cursor inside message & push ctrl-enter
  opens m-file to spot of error
debugging help, 
  type finding errors in the help search, 3rd choice in Matlab section
  also type using debugging features in search box, 1st choice in matlab
can create a custom GUI
Random array ina range: a = 10; b = 50; x = a + (b-a) * rand(5)
M-file names must start with an alphabetic character,
  may contain any alphanumeric characters or underscores,
  and must be no longer than N = namelengthmax
  **may not have spaces, use underscores
%automatic in the callback function attribute of a new item will have
  GUIDE input the tag name into the callback & also create a function
  that exectues w/the callback
