<p><em>This feature is still in development and has been included for testing purposes only.&nbsp; Any feedback about this feature is welcome and encouraged.</em>&nbsp; This menu item is for advanced students who want to learn about circular convolution.&nbsp;
By selecting this option, the MATLAB convolution tool will be put into Circular Convolution mode.&nbsp; In this mode there are four axes.&nbsp;  The new axis displays the circular convolution results.&nbsp;  The user can adjust the circular convolution length by dragging the capital N text and arrow around.&nbsp; 
The linear convolution axis still shows the full linear convolution, but also displays points 
which get aliased in red.</p>

<p>This menu puts the MATLAB convolution tool into Tutorial Mode.&nbsp; Unchecking the
menu item returns the window to its normal mode.&nbsp; In Tutorial Mode, the <strong>Output
</strong>plot is hidden from view and replaced by a <strong>Get Output</strong> button.
&nbsp; Clicking the button unhides the <strong>Output Plot</strong> and the convolution
result is shown.&nbsp; When the <strong>Output Plot</strong> is shown, clicking inside the
plot area will replace the plot with the <strong>Get Ouput</strong> button again.&nbsp; If
new signals are picked, the <strong>Output</strong> plot will be hidden from view
automatically.<br>
<br>
This feature was implemented so students could try to guess the result before actually
seeing it.&nbsp; A lecturer using the tool as a lecture aid might want to use this feature
to hide the convolution result while teaching students how to calculate it.</p>

<p>This menu item maximizes the use of the screen by removing the formula text box from
the window, converting the command buttons into menu items, and stretching the 3 main
plots so that they fill the entire window.&nbsp; Unchecking the menu item returns the
window to its normal mode.&nbsp; This feature was implemented as a lecture aid to both
de-clutter the screen and to maximize the screen usage which is important when projecting
the image of the computer screen in a classroom environment.</p>

<p>This menu item allows you to bring the index back to its default position of <strong>n</strong>
&nbsp; = -5.&nbsp; You probably will not need to do this unless the signals are dragged
outside the plot box where, admittedly, the program animation is not as smooth.</p>

<A name="Plot Options: Set Line Width">
<DIV class="Subheading"> &nbsp;
   Plot Options: &nbsp; Set Line Width
</DIV>
</A>

<p>This menu item allows you to interactively change the default line width used in all
the plots.&nbsp; This feature was implemented as a lecture aid since thin lines are
sometimes hard to see from the back of a room when projecting an image of a computer
screen.</p>

<p>When in Conserve Space mode, this menu item allow you to exit the MATLAB convolution
tool since the button usually used for this purpose is no longer in the main window.</p>

<p>When in Conserve Space mode, these menu items allow you to pick new signals for x[n]
and h[n] since the buttons that are usually used for this purpose are no longer in the
main window.</p>

<p>When in Conserve Space mode,&nbsp; these menu items allow you to change which signal is
being flipped since the radio buttons usually used for this purpose are no longer in the
main window.&nbsp; Note that only one of these menu items will appear depending on the
current signal being flipped</p>

<p>This menu item tries to launch the host computer's internet browser and to load the <code>index.html</code>
page found in the <code>help</code> directory.&nbsp; If an error occurs you can manually
load the page into your browser or navigate to <a

where another copy of the help pages are found.&nbsp; (Of course, you probably know this
or else you could not be reading this!)</p>
